Katia Basso studies the process of differentiation of germinal center B cells and the mechanisms of malignant transformation leading to lymphomagenesis. Her interest is in dissecting the transcriptional networks that drive normal B cell differentiation and are hijacked in lymphomas. She integrates omics technologies, molecular and cellular biology, and in-vivo modeling to characterize normal B cells and their malignant counterparts. Her research informs on lymphoma features and dependences that impact diagnostics and therapeutics.
