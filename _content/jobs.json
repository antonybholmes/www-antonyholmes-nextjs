    "company": "Institute for Cancer Genetics Columbia University New York",
    "date": "2015 - Present",
    "overview": "I design data pipelines for processing single cell RNA-seq data as well as specialized biology application development, database administration, and REST based web application development.",
    "details": [
      "Developed database backed genomic web applications running on Amazon Web Services using a mixture of Django, Spring Boot, and Postgresql.",
      "Developed and implemented a strategy to move lab data and core applications onto Amazon Web Services for significant cost savings.",
      "Served as AWS administrator and full stack developer for our group working on database and web applications using S3, EC2, Cloudfront for deployment to a team of 20 people.",
      "Managed the complete redesign of the Institute for Cancer Genetic's web site as a JAMStack application using React and Gatsby in less than 6 months. This modernized and optimized the site to be performant as well as offering a solution tailored to the institute's need. It resulted in a saving of $40,000 by eliminating the reliance on Drupal and an external provider to manage it."
