    "title": "Rad53 arrests leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis via distinct mechanisms in response to DNA replication stress",
    "abstract": "DNA replication stress threatens ordinary DNA synthesis. The evolutionarily conserved DNA replication stress response pathway involves sensor kinase Mec1/ATR, adaptor protein Mrc1/Claspin, and effector kinase Rad53/Chk1, which spurs a host of changes to stabilize replication forks and maintain genome integrity. DNA replication forks consist of largely distinct sets of proteins at leading and lagging strands that function autonomously in DNA synthesis in vitro. In this article, we discuss eSPAN and BrdU-IP-ssSeq, strand-specific sequencing technologies that permit analysis of protein localization and DNA synthesis at individual strands in budding yeast. Using these approaches, we show that under replication stress Rad53 stalls DNA synthesis on both leading and lagging strands. On lagging strands, it stimulates PCNA unloading, and on leading strands, it attenuates the replication function of Mrc1-Tof1. We propose that in doing so, Rad53 couples leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis during replication stress, thereby preventing the emergence of harmful ssDNA.",

    "title": "Methionine oxidation activates pyruvate kinase M2 to promote pancreatic cancer metastasis",
    "abstract": "Cancer mortality is primarily a consequence of its metastatic spread. Here, we report that methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MSRA), which can reduce oxidized methionine residues, acts as a suppressor of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) metastasis. MSRA expression is decreased in the metastatic tumors of PDA patients, whereas MSRA loss in primary PDA cells promotes migration and invasion. Chemoproteomic profiling of pancreatic organoids revealed that MSRA loss results in the selective oxidation of a methionine residue (M239) in pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). Moreover, M239 oxidation sustains PKM2 in an active tetrameric state to promote respiration, migration, and metastasis, whereas pharmacological activation of PKM2 increases cell migration and metastasis in\u00a0vivo. These results demonstrate that methionine residues can act as reversible redox switches governing distinct signaling outcomes and that the MSRA-PKM2 axis serves as a regulatory nexus between redox biology and cancer metabolism to control tumor metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) and 2 (PARP2) are two DNA damage-induced poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerases in cells and are the targets of PARP inhibitors used for cancer therapy. Strand breaks recruit and activate PARP1 and 2, which rapidly generate PAR from NAD+. PAR promotes the recruitment of other repair factors, relaxes chromatin, and has a role in DNA repair, transcription regulation, and RNA biology. Four PARP1/2 dual inhibitors are currently used to treat BRCA-deficient breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancers. In addition to blocking the enzymatic activity of PARP1 and 2, clinical PARP inhibitors extend the appearance of PARP1 and PARP2 on chromatin after damage, termed trapping. Loss of PARP1 confers resistance to PARP inhibitors, suggesting an essential role of trapping in cancer therapy. Yet, whether the persistent PARP1 and 2 foci at the DNA damage sites are caused by the retention of the same molecules or by the continual exchange of different molecules remains unknown. Here, we discuss recent results from quantitative live-cell imaging studies focusing on PARP1 and PARP2's distinct DNA substrate specificities and modes of recruitment and trapping with implications for cancer therapy and on-target toxicities of PARP inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastomas are incurable tumors infiltrating the brain. A subpopulation of glioblastoma cells forms a functional and therapy-resistant tumor cell network interconnected by tumor microtubes (TMs). Other subpopulations appear unconnected, and their biological role remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that whole-brain colonization is fueled by glioblastoma cells that lack connections with other tumor cells and astrocytes yet receive synaptic input from neurons. This subpopulation corresponds to neuronal and neural-progenitor-like tumor cell states, as defined by single-cell transcriptomics, both in mouse models and in the human disease. Tumor cell invasion resembled neuronal migration mechanisms and adopted a L\u00e9vy-like movement pattern of probing the environment. Neuronal activity induced complex calcium signals in glioblastoma cells followed by the de novo formation of TMs and increased invasion speed. Collectively, superimposing molecular and functional single-cell data revealed that neuronal mechanisms govern glioblastoma cell invasion on multiple levels. This explains how glioblastoma's dissemination and cellular heterogeneity are closely interlinked.",

    "abstract": "Diffuse large B\u00a0cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and remains incurable in around 40% of patients. Efforts to sequence the coding genome identified several genes and pathways that are altered in this disease, including potential therapeutic targets                 1-5                . However, the non-coding genome of DLBCL remains largely unexplored. Here we show that active super-enhancers are highly and specifically hypermutated in 92% of samples from individuals with DLBCL, display signatures of activation-induced cytidine deaminase activity, and are linked to genes that encode B cell developmental regulators and oncogenes. As evidence of oncogenic relevance, we show that the hypermutated super-enhancers linked to the BCL6, BCL2 and CXCR4 proto-oncogenes prevent the binding and transcriptional downregulation of the corresponding target gene by transcriptional repressors, including BLIMP1 (targeting BCL6) and the steroid receptor NR3C1 (targeting BCL2 and CXCR4). Genetic correction of selected mutations restored repressor DNA binding, downregulated target gene expression and led to the counter-selection of cells containing corrected alleles, indicating an oncogenic dependency on the super-enhancer mutations. This pervasive super-enhancer mutational mechanism reveals a major set of genetic lesions deregulating gene expression, which expands the involvement of known oncogenes in DLBCL pathogenesis and identifies new deregulated gene targets of therapeutic relevance.",

    "abstract": "The Plant Homeodomain 6 gene (PHF6) encodes a nucleolar and chromatin-associated leukemia tumor suppressor with proposed roles in transcription regulation. However, specific molecular mechanisms controlled by PHF6 remain rudimentarily understood. Here we show that PHF6 engages multiple nucleosome remodeling protein complexes, including nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase, SWI/SNF and ISWI factors, the replication machinery and DNA repair proteins. Moreover, after DNA damage, PHF6 localizes to sites of DNA injury, and its loss impairs the resolution of DNA breaks, with consequent accumulation of single- and double-strand DNA lesions. Native chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analyses show that PHF6 specifically associates with difficult-to-replicate heterochromatin at satellite DNA regions enriched in histone H3 lysine 9 trimethyl marks, and single-molecule locus-specific analyses identify PHF6 as an important regulator of genomic stability at fragile sites. These results extend our understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis and leukemia transformation by placing PHF6 at the crossroads of chromatin remodeling, replicative fork dynamics, and DNA repair.",

To identify treatment-associated cellular and genetic changes, we analyzed RNA and/or DNA sequencing data from the temporally separated tumor pairs of 304 adult patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wild-type and IDH-mutant glioma. Tumors recurred in distinct manners that were dependent on IDH mutation status and attributable to changes in histological feature composition, somatic alterations, and microenvironment interactions. Hypermutation and acquired CDKN2A deletions were associated with an increase in proliferating neoplastic cells at recurrence in both glioma subtypes, reflecting active tumor growth. IDH-wild-type tumors were more invasive at recurrence, and their neoplastic cells exhibited increased expression of neuronal signaling programs that reflected a possible role for neuronal interactions in promoting glioma progression. Mesenchymal transition was associated with the presence of a myeloid cell state defined by specific ligand-receptor interactions with neoplastic cells. Collectively, these recurrence-associated phenotypes represent potential targets to alter disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Newly synthesized H3.1 and H3.3 histones are assembled into nucleosomes by different histone chaperones in replication-coupled and replication-independent pathways, respectively. However, it is not clear how parental H3.3 molecules are transferred following DNA replication, especially when compared to H3.1. Here, by monitoring parental H3.1- and H3.3-SNAP signals, we show that parental H3.3, like H3.1, are stably transferred into daughter cells. Moreover, Mcm2-Pola1 and Pole3-Pole4, two pathways involved in parental histone transfer based upon the analysis of modifications on parental histones, participate in the transfer of both H3.1 and H3.3 following DNA replication. Lastly, we found that Mcm2, Pole3 and Pole4 mutants defective in parental histone transfer show defects in chromosome segregation. These results indicate that in contrast to deposition of newly synthesized H3.1 and H3.3, transfer of parental H3.1 and H3.3 is mediated by these shared mechanisms, which contributes to epigenetic memory of gene expression and maintenance of genome stability.",

Here, we show that                 mcm2-3A                and                 dpb3                \u2206 mutant cells markedly reduce the asymmetric distribution of H3K4me3 during cell cycle progression before mitosis. Furthermore, the restoration of a more symmetric distribution of H3K4me3 at replicating DNA strands in these mutant cells is driven by methylating nucleosomes without H3K4me3 by the H3K4 methyltransferase complex, COMPASS. Last, both gene transcription machinery and the binding of parental H3K4me3 by Spp1 subunit of the COMPASS complex help recruit the enzyme to chromatin for the restoration of the H3K4me3-marked state following DNA replication, shedding light on inheritance of this mark following DNA replication.",

    "abstract": "Although the conventional activities of p53 such as cell cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis are well accepted as the major checkpoints in stress responses, accumulating evidence implicates the importance of other tumor suppression mechanisms. Among these unconventional activities, an iron-dependent form of non-apoptotic cell death, termed ferroptosis, attracts great interest. Unlike apoptotic cell death, activation of p53 alone is not sufficient to induce ferroptosis directly; instead, through its metabolic targets, p53 is able to modulate the ferroptosis response in the presence of ferroptosis inducers such as GPX4 inhibitors or high levels of ROS. Here, we review the role of ferroptosis in p53-mediated tumor suppression, with a focus on what cellular factors are critical for p53-dependent ferroptosis during tumor suppression and how p53 modulates both the canonical (GPX4-dependent) and the non-canonical (GPX4-independent) ferroptosis pathways. We also discuss the possibility of targeting p53-mediated ferroptotic responses for the treatment of human cancers and potentially, other diseases.",

    "abstract": "LRWD1, also known as ORCA, is a nuclear protein functioning in multiple biological processes. Using its WD40 domain LRWD1 interacts with repressive histone marks and maintains the silencing of heterochromatin regions in mammalian cells. ORCA also associates with the origin recognition complex (ORC) and facilitates prereplication complex formation at late-replicating origins. However, whether LRWD1 plays a role during development and the functional significance of LRWD1 in vivo remains largely unknown. Using gene-trap approach we generated Lrwd1 knockout mice and examined the expression of Lrwd1 during embryonic development. We found that Lrwd1 is ubiquitously expressed in the majority of the developing mouse embryo. Depletion of LRWD1 did not affect embryonic development but the postnatal growth of the homozygous mutants is retarded. In vitro cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) depleted of LRWD1 displayed a reduced proliferation compared to wild type cells. We also showed that the knockout of Lrwd1 in MEFs increased the expression of the epigenetically silenced repetitive elements but with minimal effect on the expression of protein coding genes. Together, these results suggest that LRWD1 plays an important, but not essential, role in postnatal development by regulating cell proliferation likely through modulating DNA replication.",

    "abstract": "Although it is well-established that p53-mediated tumor suppression mainly acts through its ability in transcriptional regulation, the molecular mechanisms of this regulation are not completely understood. Among a number of regulatory modes, acetylation of p53 attracts great interests. p53 was one of the first non-histone proteins found to be functionally regulated by acetylation and deacetylation, and subsequent work has established that reversible acetylation is a general mechanism for regulation of non-histone proteins. Unlike other types of posttranslational modifications occurred during stress responses, the role of p53 acetylation has been recently validated in vivo by using the knock-in mice with both acetylation-defective and acetylation-mimicking p53 mutants. Here, we review the role of acetylation in p53-mediated activities, with a focus on which specific acetylation sites are critical for p53-dependent transcription regulation during tumor suppression and how acetylation of p53 recruits specific \"readers\" to execute its promoter-specific regulation of different targets. We also discuss the role of p53 acetylation in differentially regulating its classic activities in cell cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis as well as newly identified unconventional functions such as cell metabolism and ferroptosis.",

    "abstract": "Giant cells with polyploidy, termed polyploid giant cells, have been observed during normal growth, development, and pathologic states, such as solid cancer progression and resistance to therapy. Functional studies of polyploidal giant cancer cells (PGCC) provided evidence that they arise when normal diploid cells are stressed, show stem cell-like properties, and give rise to tumors. In the present study, we report in K562 leukemia cell line that introduction of the hotspot K700E mutation in the gene SF3B1 using CRISPR/Cas9 method results in an increased frequency of multinucleated polyploid giant cells resistant to chemotherapeutic agent and serum starvation stress. These giant cells with higher ploidy are distinct from multinucleated megakaryocytes, are proliferative, and are characterized by increased accumulation of mitochondria. PGCC have been previously documented in solid tumors. This is the first report describing PGCCs in a cell line derived from a liquid cancer where increased frequency of PGCCs is linked to a specific genetic event. Since SF3B1 mutations are predominantly seen in MDS and other hematologic malignancies, our current findings will have significant clinical implications.",

    "abstract": "Dual-inhibitors of PARP1 and PARP2 are promising anti-cancer drugs. In addition to blocking PARP1&2 enzymatic activity, PARP inhibitors also extend the lifetime of DNA damage-induced PARP1&2 foci, termed trapping. Trapping is important for the therapeutic effects of PARP inhibitors. Using live-cell imaging, we found that PARP inhibitors cause persistent PARP2 foci by switching the mode of PARP2 recruitment from a predominantly PARP1- and PAR-dependent rapid exchange to a WGR domain-mediated stalling of PARP2 on DNA. Specifically, PARP1-deletion markedly reduces but does not abolish PARP2 foci. The residual PARP2 foci in PARP1-deficient cells are DNA-dependent and abrogated by the R140A mutation in the WGR domain. Yet, PARP2-R140A forms normal foci in PARP1-proficient cells. In PARP1-deficient cells, PARP inhibitors - niraparib, talazoparib, and, to a lesser extent, olaparib - enhance PARP2 foci by preventing PARP2 exchange. This trapping of PARP2 is independent of auto-PARylation and is abolished by the R140A mutation in the WGR domain and the H415A mutation in the catalytic domain. Taken together, we found that PARP inhibitors trap PARP2 by physically stalling PARP2 on DNA via the WGR-DNA interaction while suppressing the PARP1- and PAR-dependent rapid exchange of PARP2.",

How oncogenic NOTCH1 signaling launches a leukemia-prone chromatin landscape during T-ALL initiation is unknown. Here we demonstrate an essential role for the high-mobility-group transcription factor Tcf1 in orchestrating chromatin accessibility and topology, allowing aberrant Notch1 signaling to convey its oncogenic function. Although essential, Tcf1 is not sufficient to initiate leukemia. The formation of a leukemia-prone epigenetic landscape at the distal Notch1-regulated Myc enhancer, which is fundamental to this disease, is Tcf1-dependent and occurs within the earliest progenitor stage even before cells adopt a T lymphocyte or leukemic fate. Moreover, we discovered a unique evolutionarily conserved Tcf1-regulated enhancer element in the distal Myc-enhancer, which is important for the transition of preleukemic cells to full-blown disease.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral T\u00a0cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) comprises heterogeneous lymphoid malignancies characterized by pleomorphic lymphocytes and variable inflammatory cell-rich tumor microenvironment. Genetic drivers in PTCL-NOS include genomic alterations affecting the VAV1 oncogene; however, their specific role and mechanisms in PTCL-NOS remain incompletely understood. Here we show that expression of Vav1-Myo1f, a recurrent PTCL-associated VAV1 fusion, induces oncogenic transformation of CD4                 +                T\u00a0cells. Notably, mouse Vav1-Myo1f lymphomas show T helper type 2 features analogous to high-risk GATA3                 +                human PTCL. Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals that Vav1-Myo1f alters T\u00a0cell differentiation and leads to accumulation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment, a feature linked with aggressiveness in human PTCL. Importantly, therapeutic targeting of TAMs induces strong anti-lymphoma effects, highlighting the lymphoma cells' dependency on the microenvironment. These results demonstrate an oncogenic role for Vav1-Myo1f in the pathogenesis of PTCL, involving deregulation in T\u00a0cell polarization, and identify the lymphoma-associated macrophage-tumor microenvironment as a therapeutic target in PTCL.",

    "abstract": "Tissue-specific transcriptional activity is silenced in mitotic cells but it remains unclear whether the mitotic regulatory machinery interacts with tissue-specific transcriptional programs. We show that such cross-talk involves the controlled interaction between core subunits of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) and the ID2 substrate. The N-terminus of ID2 is independently and structurally compatible with a pocket composed of core APC/C subunits that may optimally orient ID2 onto the APC                 CDH1                complex. Phosphorylation of serine-5 by CDK1 prevented the association of ID2 with core APC, impaired ubiquitylation and stabilized ID2 protein at the mitosis-G1 transition leading to inhibition of basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH)-mediated transcription. The serine-5 phospho-mimetic mutant of ID2 that inefficiently bound core APC remained stable during mitosis, delayed exit from mitosis and reloading of bHLH transcription factors on chromatin. It also locked cells into a \"mitotic stem cell\" transcriptional state resembling the pluripotent program of embryonic stem cells. The substrates of APC                 CDH1                SKP2 and Cyclin B1 share with ID2 the phosphorylation-dependent, D-box-independent interaction with core APC.

    "abstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) osimertinib has significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer, including those with brain metastases. However, despite striking initial responses, osimertinib-treated patients eventually develop lethal metastatic relapse, often to the brain. Although osimertinib-refractory brain relapse is a major clinical challenge, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using metastatic models of EGFR-mutant lung cancer, we show that cancer cells expressing high intracellular S100A9 escape osimertinib and initiate brain relapses. Mechanistically, S100A9 upregulates ALDH1A1 expression and activates the retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway in osimertinib-refractory cancer cells. We demonstrate that the genetic repression of S100A9, ALDH1A1, or RA receptors (RAR) in cancer cells, or treatment with a pan-RAR antagonist, dramatically reduces brain metastasis. Importantly, S100A9 expression in cancer cells correlates with poor PFS in osimertinib-treated patients. Our study, therefore, identifies a novel, therapeutically targetable S100A9-ALDH1A1-RA axis that drives brain relapse.",

    "abstract": "The cystine/glutamate antiporter SLC7A11 (commonly known as xCT) functions to import cystine for glutathione biosynthesis, thereby protecting cells from oxidative stress and ferroptosis, a regulated form of non-apoptotic cell death driven by the accumulation of lipid-based reactive oxygen species (ROS). p14                 ARF                , a well-established tumor suppressor, promotes ferroptosis by inhibiting NRF2-mediated SLC7A11 transcription. Here, we demonstrate the crucial role of Cullin 2 RING E3 ligase (CRL2)-KLHDC3 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex in regulating p14                 ARF                protein stability. KLHDC3 acts as a CRL2 adaptor that specifically recognizes a C-terminal degron in p14                 ARF                and triggers p14                 ARF                for ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation. This regulation mode is absent in the murine p14                 ARF                homolog, p19                 arf                which lacks the C-terminal degron. We also show that KLHDC3 suppresses ferroptosis in vitro and supports tumor growth in vivo by relieving p14                 ARF                -mediated suppression of SLC7A11 transcription. Overall, these findings reveal that the protein stability and pro-ferroptotic function of p14                 ARF                are controlled by a CRL2 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and suggest that suppression of the p14                 ARF-                NRF2-SLC7A11 regulatory pathway by KLHDC3 overexpression likely contributes to cancer progression.",

    "abstract": "Early T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy associated with early relapse and poor prognosis that is genetically, immunophenotypically, and transcriptionally distinct from more mature T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) tumors. Here, we leveraged global metabolomic and transcriptomic profiling of primary ETP- and T-ALL leukemia samples to identify specific metabolic circuitries differentially active in this high-risk leukemia group. ETP-ALLs showed increased biosynthesis of phospholipids and sphingolipids and were specifically sensitive to inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. Mechanistically, inhibition of cholesterol synthesis inhibited oncogenic AKT1 signaling and suppressed MYC expression via loss of chromatin accessibility at a leukemia stem cell-specific long-range MYC enhancer. In all, these results identify the mevalonate pathway as a druggable novel vulnerability in high-risk ETP-ALL cells and uncover an unanticipated critical role for cholesterol biosynthesis in signal transduction and epigenetic circuitries driving leukemia cell growth and survival.",

    "abstract": "Nucleosomes are disrupted transiently during eukaryotic transcription, yet the displaced histones must be retained and redeposited onto DNA, to preserve nucleosome density and associated histone modifications. Here, we show that the essential Spt5 processivity factor of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) plays a direct role in this process in budding yeast. Functional orthologues of eukaryotic Spt5 are present in archaea and bacteria, reflecting its universal role in RNA polymerase processivity. However, eukaryotic Spt5 is unique in having an acidic amino terminal tail (Spt5N) that is sandwiched between the downstream nucleosome and the upstream DNA that emerges from Pol II. We show that Spt5N contains a histone-binding motif that is required for viability in yeast cells and prevents loss of nucleosomal histones within actively transcribed regions. These findings indicate that eukaryotic Spt5 combines two essential activities, which together couple processive transcription to the efficient capture and re-deposition of nucleosomal histones.",

    "abstract": "Protein kinase inhibitors are amongst the most successful cancer treatments, but targetable kinases activated by genomic abnormalities are rare in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Nevertheless, kinases can be activated in the absence of genetic defects. Thus, phosphoproteomics can provide information on pathway activation and signaling networks that offer opportunities for targeted therapy. Here, we describe a mass spectrometry-based global phosphoproteomic profiling of 11\u2009T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines to identify targetable kinases. We report a comprehensive dataset consisting of 21,000 phosphosites on 4,896 phosphoproteins, including 217 kinases. We identify active Src-family kinases signaling as well as active cyclin-dependent kinases. We validate putative targets for therapy ex vivo and identify potential combination treatments, such as the inhibition of the INSR/IGF-1R axis to increase the sensitivity to dasatinib treatment. Ex vivo validation of selected drug combinations using patient-derived xenografts provides a proof-of-concept for phosphoproteomics-guided design of personalized treatments.",

    "abstract": "Mixed-phenotype acute leukemia is a rare subtype of leukemia in which both myeloid and lymphoid markers are co-expressed on the same malignant cells. The pathogenesis is largely unknown, and the treatment is challenging. We previously reported the specific association of the recurrent t(8;12)(q13;p13) chromosomal translocation that creates the ETV6-NCOA2 fusion with T/myeloid leukemias. Here we report that ETV6-NCOA2 initiates T/myeloid leukemia in preclinical models; ectopic expression of ETV6-NCOA2 in mouse bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors induced T/myeloid lymphoma accompanied by spontaneous Notch1-activating mutations. Similarly, cotransduction of human cord blood CD34+ progenitors with ETV6-NCOA2 and a nontransforming NOTCH1 mutant induced T/myeloid leukemia in immunodeficient mice; the immunophenotype and gene expression pattern were similar to those of patient-derived ETV6-NCOA2 leukemias. Mechanistically, we show that ETV6-NCOA2 forms a transcriptional complex with ETV6 and the histone acetyltransferase p300, leading to derepression of ETV6 target genes. The expression of ETV6-NCOA2 in human and mouse nonthymic hematopoietic progenitor cells induces transcriptional dysregulation, which activates a lymphoid program while failing to repress the expression of myeloid genes such as CSF1 and MEF2C. The ETV6-NCOA2 induced arrest at an early immature T-cell developmental stage. The additional acquisition of activating NOTCH1 mutations transforms the early immature ETV6-NCOA2 cells into T/myeloid leukemias. Here, we describe the first preclinical model to depict the initiation of T/myeloid leukemia by a specific somatic genetic aberration.",

    "abstract": "In response to T-cell-dependent antigens, mature B cells in the secondary lymphoid organs are stimulated to form germinal centers (GCs), which are histological structures deputed to antibody affinity maturation, a process associated with immunoglobulin gene editing by somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR). GC B cells are heterogeneous and transition across multiple stages before being eliminated by apoptosis or committing to post-GC differentiation as memory B cells or plasma cells. In order to explore the dynamics of SHM and CSR during the GC reaction, we identified GC subpopulations by single-cell (sc) transcriptomics and analyzed the load of immunoglobulin variable (V) region mutations as well as the isotype class distribution in each subpopulation. The results showed that the large majority of GC B cells display a quantitatively similar mutational load in the V regions and analogous IGH isotype class distribution, except for the precursors of memory B cells (PreM) and plasma cells (PBL). PreM showed a bimodal pattern with about half of the cells displaying high V region germline identity and enrichment for unswitched IGH, while the rest of the cells carried a mutational load similar to the bulk of GC B cells and showed a switched isotype. PBL displayed a bias toward expression of IGHG and higher V region germline identity compared to the bulk of GC B cells. Genes implicated in SHM and CSR were significantly induced in specific GC subpopulations, consistent with the occurrence of SHM in dark zone cells and suggesting that CSR can occur within the GC.",

    "abstract": "S\u00e9zary syndrome is an aggressive and disseminated form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma associated with dismal prognosis in which the histone deacetylase inhibitor romidepsin has shown remarkable activity as a single agent. However, clinical responses to romidepsin are typically transient, highlighting the need for more effective therapies. In this study, we show synergistic antilymphoma effects of romidepsin in combination with mechlorethamine, an alkylating agent, in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cell lines and primary samples with strong antitumor effects in an in\u00a0vivo model of S\u00e9zary syndrome. Mechanistically, gene expression profiling points to abrogation of Jak/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling as an important mediator of this interaction. Consistently, the combination of mechlorethamine plus romidepsin resulted in downregulation of STAT5 phosphorylation in romidepsin-sensitive cell lines and primary S\u00e9zary syndrome samples, but not in romidepsin-resistant tumors. Moreover, in further support of Jak/STAT signaling as a modulator of romidepsin activity in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, treatment with romidepsin in combination with Jak inhibitors resulted in markedly increased therapeutic responses. Overall, these results support a role for romidepsin plus mechlorethamine in combination in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and uncover a previously unrecognized role for Jak/STAT signaling in the response to romidepsin and romidepsin-based combination therapies in S\u00e9zary syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Lineage-ambiguous leukemias are high-risk malignancies of poorly understood genetic basis. Here, we describe a distinct subgroup of acute leukemia with expression of myeloid, T lymphoid, and stem cell markers driven by aberrant allele-specific deregulation of                 BCL11B                , a master transcription factor responsible for thymic T-lineage commitment and specification. Mechanistically, this deregulation was driven by chromosomal rearrangements that juxtapose                 BCL11B                to superenhancers active in hematopoietic progenitors, or focal amplifications that generate a superenhancer from a noncoding element distal to                 BCL11B                . Chromatin conformation analyses demonstrated long-range interactions of rearranged enhancers with the expressed                 BCL11B                allele and association of                 BCL11B                with activated hematopoietic progenitor cell                 cis                -regulatory elements, suggesting BCL11B is aberrantly co-opted into a gene regulatory network that drives transformation by maintaining a progenitor state. These data support a role for ectopic                 BCL11B                expression in primitive hematopoietic cells mediated by enhancer hijacking as an oncogenic driver of human lineage-ambiguous leukemia. SIGNIFICANCE: Lineage-ambiguous leukemias pose significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges due to a poorly understood molecular and cellular basis. We identify oncogenic deregulation of                 BCL11B                driven by diverse structural alterations, including                 de novo                superenhancer generation, as the driving feature of a subset of lineage-ambiguous leukemias that transcend current diagnostic boundaries.

    "title": "An unexpected role for Dicer as a reader of the unacetylated DNA binding domain of p53 in transcriptional regulation",
    "abstract": "Here, we identified Dicer as a major cellular factor that recognizes the DNA binding domain (DBD) of p53 in a manner dependent on its acetylation status. Upon binding the unacetylated DBD, Dicer is recruited to the promoters of p53 target genes, where it represses p53-mediated transcriptional activation. Conversely, knockdown or knockout of endogenous Dicer leads to up-regulation of p53-mediated transcriptional activation without increasing its protein levels. Moreover, Dicer-mediated repression is independent of its intrinsic endoribonuclease activity; instead, Dicer directly represses transcription by recruiting the SUV39H1 histone methyltransferase. However, upon DNA damage, Dicer-mediated repression is abrogated by stress-induced acetylation at the DBD of p53. Notably, the inability of acetylation-defective p53-3KR in transcription is partially but significantly restored upon loss of Dicer expression. Our study reveals that Dicer acts as an unexpected acetylation \u201creader\u201d for p53 and thus has important implications regarding the mechanism of acetylation-mediated regulation of p53 transcriptional program.",

    "abstract": "BRCA1/2 mutant tumor cells display an elevated mutation burden, the etiology of which remains unclear. Here, we report that these cells accumulate ssDNA gaps and spontaneous mutations during unperturbed DNA replication due to repriming by the DNA primase-polymerase PRIMPOL. Gap accumulation requires the DNA glycosylase SMUG1 and is exacerbated by depletion of the translesion synthesis (TLS) factor RAD18 or inhibition of the error-prone TLS polymerase complex REV1-Pol\u03b6 by the small molecule JH-RE-06. JH-RE-06 treatment of BRCA1/2-deficient cells results in reduced mutation rates and PRIMPOL- and SMUG1-dependent loss of viability. Through cellular and animal studies, we demonstrate that JH-RE-06 is preferentially toxic toward HR-deficient cancer cells. Furthermore, JH-RE-06 remains effective toward PARP inhibitor (PARPi)-resistant BRCA1 mutant cells and displays additive toxicity with crosslinking agents or PARPi. Collectively, these studies identify a protective and mutagenic role for REV1-Pol\u03b6 in BRCA1/2 mutant cells and provide the rationale for using REV1-Pol\u03b6 inhibitors to treat BRCA1/2 mutant tumors.",

    "title": "A mechanism for Rad53 to couple leading- and lagging-strand DNA synthesis under replication stress in budding yeast",
    "abstract": "In response to DNA replication stress, DNA replication checkpoint kinase Mec1 phosphorylates Mrc1, which in turn activates Rad53 to prevent the generation of deleterious single-stranded DNA, a process that remains poorly understood. We previously reported that lagging-strand DNA synthesis proceeds farther than leading strand in                 rad53-1                mutant cells defective in replication checkpoint under replication stress, resulting in the exposure of long stretches of the leading-strand templates. Here, we show that asymmetric DNA synthesis is also observed in                 mec1-100                and                 mrc1-AQ                cells defective in replication checkpoint but, surprisingly, not in                 mrc1\u2206                cells in which both DNA replication and checkpoint functions of Mrc1 are missing. Furthermore, depletion of either Mrc1 or its partner, Tof1, suppresses the asymmetric DNA synthesis in                 rad53-1                mutant cells. Thus, the DNA replication checkpoint pathway couples leading- and lagging-strand DNA synthesis by attenuating the replication function of Mrc1-Tof1 under replication stress.",

    "title": "DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of CtIP at a conserved ATM/ATR site T855 promotes lymphomagenesis in mice",
    "abstract": "CtIP is a DNA end resection factor widely implicated in alternative end-joining (A-EJ)-mediated translocations in cell-based reporter systems. To address the physiological role of CtIP, an essential gene, in translocation-mediated lymphomagenesis, we introduced the T855A mutation at murine CtIP to nonhomologous end-joining and Tp53 double-deficient mice that routinely succumbed to lymphomas carrying A-EJ-mediated IgH-Myc translocations. T855 of CtIP is phosphorylated by ATM or ATR kinases upon DNA damage to promote end resection. Here, we reported that the T855A mutation of CtIP compromised the neonatal development of                 Xrcc4                  -/-                  Tp53                  -/-                 mice and the IgH-Myc translocation-driven lymphomagenesis in                 DNA-PKcs                  -/-                  Tp53                  -/-                 mice. Mechanistically, the T855A mutation limits DNA end resection length without affecting hairpin opening, translocation frequency, or fork stability. Meanwhile, after radiation, CtIP-T855A mutant cells showed a consistent decreased Chk1 phosphorylation and defects in the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint. Consistent with the role of T855A mutation in lymphomagenesis beyond translocation, the CtIP-T855A mutation also delays splenomegaly in \u03bb-Myc mice. Collectively, our study revealed a role of CtIP-T855 phosphorylation in lymphomagenesis beyond A-EJ-mediated chromosomal translocation.",

Dissecting how the involved genes contribute to the physiology and pathology of germinal center (GC) B cells -the origin of most B-cell lymphomas- will be key to advance our ability to diagnose and treat these patients. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) that faithfully recapitulate lymphoma-associated genetic alterations offer a valuable platform to investigate the pathogenic roles of candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressors                 in vivo                , and to pre-clinically develop new therapeutic principles in the context of an intact tumor immune microenvironment. In this review, we provide a summary of state-of-the art GEMMs obtained by accurately modelling the most common genetic alterations found in human GC B cell malignancies, with a focus on Burkitt lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and we discuss how lessons learned from these models can help guide the design of novel therapeutic approaches for this disease.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factor forkhead box O1 (FOXO1), which instructs the dark zone program to direct germinal center (GC) polarity, is typically inactivated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signals. Here, we investigated how FOXO1 mutations targeting this regulatory axis in GC-derived B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (B-NHLs) contribute to lymphomagenesis. Examination of primary B-NHL tissues revealed that FOXO1 mutations and PI3K pathway activity were not directly correlated. Human B cell lines bearing FOXO1 mutations exhibited hyperactivation of PI3K and Stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling, and increased cell survival under stress conditions as a result of alterations in FOXO1 transcriptional affinities and activation of transcriptional programs characteristic of GC-positive selection. When modeled in mice, FOXO1 mutations conferred competitive advantage to B cells in response to key T-dependent immune signals, disrupting GC homeostasis. FOXO1 mutant transcriptional signatures were prevalent in human B-NHL and predicted poor clinical outcomes. Thus, rather than enforcing FOXO1 constitutive activity, FOXO1 mutations enable co-option of GC-positive selection programs during the pathogenesis of GC-derived lymphomas.",

    "title": "Peroxisome-driven ether-linked phospholipids biosynthesis is essential for ferroptosis",
    "abstract": "It is well established that ferroptosis is primarily induced by peroxidation of long-chain poly-unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) through nonenzymatic oxidation by free radicals or enzymatic stimulation of lipoxygenase. Although there is emerging evidence that long-chain saturated fatty acid (SFA) might be implicated in ferroptosis, it remains unclear whether and how SFA participates in the process of ferroptosis. Using endogenous metabolites and genome-wide CRISPR screening, we have identified FAR1 as a critical factor for SFA-mediated ferroptosis. FAR1 catalyzes the reduction of C16 or C18 saturated fatty acid to fatty alcohol, which is required for the synthesis of alkyl-ether lipids and plasmalogens. Inactivation of FAR1 diminishes SFA-dependent ferroptosis. Furthermore, FAR1-mediated ferroptosis is dependent on peroxisome-driven ether phospholipid biosynthesis. Strikingly, TMEM189, a newly identified gene which introduces vinyl-ether double bond into alkyl-ether lipids to generate plasmalogens abrogates FAR1-alkyl-ether lipids axis induced ferroptosis. Our study reveals a new FAR1-ether lipids-TMEM189 axis dependent ferroptosis pathway and suggests TMEM189 as a promising druggable target for anticancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian DNA base excision repair (BER) is accelerated by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) and the scaffold protein XRCC1. PARPs are sensors that detect single-strand break intermediates, but the critical role of XRCC1 during BER is unknown. Here, we show that protein complexes containing DNA polymerase \u03b2 and DNA ligase III that are assembled by XRCC1 prevent excessive engagement and activity of PARP1 during BER. As a result, PARP1 becomes \"trapped\" on BER intermediates in XRCC1-deficient cells in a manner similar to that induced by PARP inhibitors, including in patient fibroblasts from XRCC1-mutated disease. This excessive PARP1 engagement and trapping renders BER intermediates inaccessible to enzymes such as DNA polymerase \u03b2 and impedes their repair. Consequently, PARP1 deletion rescues BER and resistance to base damage in XRCC1                 -/-                cells. These data reveal excessive PARP1 engagement during BER as a threat to genome integrity and identify XRCC1 as an \"anti-trapper\" that prevents toxic PARP1 activity.",

    "abstract": "Here, we identify iPLA2\u03b2 as a critical regulator for p53-driven ferroptosis upon reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced stress. The calcium-independent phospholipase iPLA2\u03b2 is known to cleave acyl tails from the glycerol backbone of lipids and release oxidized fatty acids from phospholipids. We found that iPLA2\u03b2-mediated detoxification of peroxidized lipids is sufficient to suppress p53-driven ferroptosis upon ROS-induced stress, even in GPX4-null cells. Moreover, iPLA2\u03b2 is overexpressed in human cancers; inhibition of endogenous iPLA2\u03b2 sensitizes tumor cells to p53-driven ferroptosis and promotes p53-dependent tumor suppression in xenograft mouse models. These results demonstrate that iPLA2\u03b2 acts as a major ferroptosis repressor in a GPX4-independent manner. Notably, unlike GPX4, loss of iPLA2\u03b2 has no obvious effect on normal development or cell viability in normal tissues but iPLA2\u03b2 plays an essential role in regulating ferroptosis upon ROS-induced stress. Thus, our study suggests that iPLA2\u03b2 is a promising therapeutic target for activating ferroptosis-mediated tumor suppression without serious toxicity concerns.",

    "abstract": "The germinal center (GC) reaction is a key feature of adaptive humoral immunity. GCs represent the site where mature B cells refine their B-cell receptor (BCR) and are selected based on the newly acquired affinity for the antigen. In the GC, B cells undergo multiple cycles of proliferation, BCR remodeling by immunoglobulin somatic hypermutation (SHM), and affinity-based selection before emerging as effector memory B cells or antibody-secreting plasma cells. At least 2 histologically and functionally distinct compartments are identified in the GC: the dark zone (DZ) and the light zone (LZ). The proliferative burst and immunoglobulin remodeling by SHM occur prevalently in the DZ compartment. In the LZ, GC B cells undergo an affinity-based selection process that requires the interaction with the antigen and accessory cells. GC B cells are also targeted by class switch recombination, an additional mechanism of immunoglobulin remodeling that ensures the expression of diverse isotype classes. These processes are regulated by a complex network of transcription factors, epigenetic modifiers, and signaling pathways that act in concert with mechanisms of intra-GC B-cell trafficking. The same mechanisms underlying the unique ability of GC B cells to generate high affinity antibodies and ensure immunological memory are hijacked during lymphomagenesis and become powerful weapons for malignant transformation. This review will summarize the main processes and transcriptional networks that drive GC B-cell development and are relevant for human B-cell lymphomagenesis.",

With the current treatment of surgery followed by chemoradiation, outcomes remain poor, with median survival of only 15 months and a 5-year survival rate of 6.8%. A challenge in treating GBM is the heterogeneous integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which limits the bioavailability of systemic therapies to the brain. There is a growing interest in enhancing drug delivery by opening the BBB with the use of focused ultrasound (FUS). We hypothesize that an FUS-mediated BBB opening can enhance the delivery of etoposide for a therapeutic benefit in GBM.",

    "abstract": "Fifty percent of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cases lack cell-surface expression of the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I), thus escaping recognition by cytotoxic T cells. Here we show that, across B cell lymphomas, loss of MHC-I, but not MHC-II, is preferentially restricted to DLBCL. To identify the involved mechanisms, we performed whole exome and targeted HLA deep-sequencing in 74 DLBCL samples, and found somatic inactivation of                 B2M                and the                 HLA-I                loci in 80% (34 of 42) of MHC-I                 NEG                tumors. Furthermore, 70% (22 of 32) of MHC-I                 POS                DLBCLs harbored monoallelic HLA-I genetic alterations (MHC-I                 POS/mono                ), indicating allele-specific inactivation. MHC-I                 NEG                and MHC-I                 POS/mono                cases harbored significantly higher mutational burden and inferred neoantigen load, suggesting potential coselection of                 HLA-I                loss and sustained neoantigen production. Notably, the analysis of >500,000 individuals across different cancer types revealed common germline                 HLA-I                homozygosity, preferentially in DLBCL. In mice, germinal-center B cells lacking HLA-I expression did not progress to lymphoma and were counterselected in the context of oncogene-driven lymphomagenesis, suggesting that additional events are needed to license immune evasion. These results suggest a multistep process of                 HLA-I                loss in DLBCL development including both germline and somatic events, and have direct implications for the pathogenesis and immunotherapeutic targeting of this disease.",

ID proteins inhibit basic-HLH transcription factors often blocking differentiation and sustaining proliferation. A small-molecule, AGX51, targets ID proteins for degradation and impairs ocular neovascularization in mouse models. Here we show that AGX51 treatment of cancer cell lines impairs cell growth and viability that results from an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production upon ID degradation. In mouse models, AGX51 treatment suppresses breast cancer colonization in the lung, regresses the growth of paclitaxel-resistant breast tumors when combined with paclitaxel and reduces tumor burden in sporadic colorectal neoplasia. Furthermore, in cells and mice, we fail to observe acquired resistance to AGX51 likely the result of the inability to mutate the binding pocket without loss of ID function and efficient degradation of the ID proteins. Thus, AGX51 is a first-in-class compound that antagonizes ID proteins, shows strong anti-tumor effects and may be further developed for the management of multiple cancers.",

Given the growing number of diagnostic and therapeutic applications of AgNCs, we evaluated the impact of AgNCs on DNA replication and DNA damage response in cell-free extracts prepared from unfertilized Xenopus laevis eggs. We find that, among a number of silver nanomaterials, AgNCs uniquely inhibited genomic DNA replication and abrogated the DNA replication checkpoint in cell-free extracts. AgNCs did not affect nuclear membrane or nucleosome assembly. AgNCs-supplemented extracts showed a strong defect in the loading of the mini chromosome maintenance (MCM) protein complex, the helicase that unwinds DNA ahead of replication forks. FLAG-AgNCs immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis of AgNCs associated proteins demonstrated direct interaction between MCM and AgNCs. Our studies indicate that AgNCs directly prevent the loading of MCM, blocking pre-replication complex (pre-RC) assembly and subsequent DNA replication initiation. Collectively, our findings broaden the scope of silver nanomaterials experimental applications, establishing AgNCs as a novel tool to study chromosomal DNA replication.",

    "abstract": "Oncogenic histone lysine-to-methionine mutations block the methylation of their corresponding lysine residues on wild-type histones. One attractive model is that these mutations sequester histone methyltransferases, but genome-wide studies show that mutant histones and histone methyltransferases often do not colocalize. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), here, we show that, in fission yeast, even though H3K9M-containing nucleosomes are broadly distributed across the genome, the histone H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4 is mainly sequestered at pericentric repeats. This selective sequestration of Clr4 depends not only on H3K9M but also on H3K14 ubiquitylation (H3K14ub), a modification deposited by a Clr4-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. In\u00a0vitro, H3K14ub synergizes with H3K9M to interact with Clr4 and potentiates the inhibitory effects of H3K9M on Clr4 enzymatic activity. Moreover, binding kinetics show that H3K14ub overcomes the Clr4 aversion to H3K9M and reduces its dissociation. The selective sequestration model reconciles previous discrepancies and demonstrates the importance of protein-interaction kinetics in regulating biological processes.",

    "abstract": "Faithful duplication of both genetic and epigenetic information is essential for all eukaryotic cells. DNA replication initiates from replication origins and proceeds bidirectionally but asymmetrically, with the leading strand being synthesized continuously and the lagging strand discontinuously as Okazaki fragments by distinct DNA polymerases. Unraveling the underlying mechanisms of chromatin replication at both strands is crucial to better understand DNA replication and its coupled processes, including nucleosome assembly, sister chromatid cohesion and DNA mismatch repair. Here we describe the enrichment and sequencing of protein-associated nascent DNA (eSPAN) method to analyze the enrichment of proteins of interest, including histones and their modifications at replicating chromatin in a strand-specific manner in mammalian cells. Briefly, cells are pulsed with the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine to label newly synthesized DNA. After cell permeabilization, the target proteins are sequentially bound by antibodies and protein A-fused transposase, which digests and tags genomic DNA of interest once activated by magnesium. The strand specificity is preserved through oligo-replacement. Finally, the resulting double-strand DNA is denatured and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against bromodeoxyuridine to enrich nascent DNA associated with proteins of interest. After PCR amplification and next-generation sequencing, the mapped reads are used to calculate the relative enrichment of the target proteins around replication origins. Compared with alternative methods, the eSPAN protocol is simple, cost-effective and sensitive, even in a relatively small number of mammalian cells. The whole procedures from cell collection to generation of sequencing-ready libraries can be completed in 2 days.",

    "title": "Structural Model for Recruitment of RIT1 to the LZTR1 E3 Ligase: Evidences from an Integrated Computational Approach",
    "abstract": "Leucine-zipper transcription regulator 1 (LZTR1) is a highly mutated tumor suppressor gene, involved in the pathogenesis of several cancer types and developmental disorders. In proteasomal degradation, it acts as an adaptor protein responsible for the recognition and recruitment of substrates to be ubiquitinated in Cullin3-RING ligase E3 (CRL3) machinery. LZTR1 belongs to the BTB-Kelch family, a multi-domain protein where the Kelch propeller plays as the substrate recognition region and for which no experimental structure has been solved. Recently, large effort mutational analyses pointed to the role of disease-associated LZTR1 mutations in the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway and RIT1, a small Ras-related GTPase protein, has been identified by mass spectroscopy to interact with LZTR1. Hence, a better understanding of native structure, molecular mechanism, and substrate specificity would help clarifying the role of LZTR1 in pathological diseases, thus promoting advancement in the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we address the interaction model between adaptor LZTR1 and substrate RIT1 by applying an integrated computational approach, including molecular modeling and docking techniques. We observe that the interaction model LZTR1-RIT1 is stabilized by an electrostatic bond network established between the two protein surfaces, which is reminiscent of homologous ubiquitin ligases complexes. Then, running MD simulations, we characterize differential conformational dynamics of the multi-domain LZTR1, offering interesting implications on the mechanistic role of specific point mutations. We identify G248R and R283Q as damaging mutations involved in the recognition process of the substrate RIT1 and R412C as a possible allosteric mutation from the Kelch to the C-term BTB-domain. Our findings provide important structural insights on targeting CRL3s for drug discovery.",

Immune subtypes with distinct immune cell types are discovered using bulk omics methodologies, validated by snRNA-seq, and correlated with specific expression and histone acetylation patterns. Histone H2B acetylation in classical-like and immune-low GBM is driven largely by BRDs, CREBBP, and EP300. Integrated metabolomic and proteomic data identify specific lipid distributions across subtypes and distinct global metabolic changes in IDH-mutated tumors.

    "abstract": "Smc5/6 is essential for genome structural integrity by yet unknown mechanisms. Here we find that Smc5/6 co-localizes with the DNA crossed-strand processing complex Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 (STR) at genomic regions known as natural pausing sites (NPSs) where it facilitates Top3 retention. Individual depletions of STR subunits and Smc5/6 cause similar accumulation of joint molecules (JMs) composed of reversed forks, double Holliday Junctions and hemicatenanes, indicative of Smc5/6 regulating Sgs1 and Top3 DNA processing activities. We isolate an intra-allelic suppressor of smc6-56 proficient in Top3 retention but affected in pathways that act complementarily with Sgs1 and Top3 to resolve JMs arising at replication termination. Upon replication stress, the smc6-56 suppressor requires STR and Mus81-Mms4 functions for recovery, but not Srs2 and Mph1 helicases that prevent maturation of recombination intermediates. Thus, Smc5/6 functions jointly with Top3 and STR to mediate replication completion and influences the function of other DNA crossed-strand processing enzymes at NPSs.",

For many of those genes, the specific role in normal B-cell development is unknown; moreover, whether and how their deregulated activity contributes to lymphoma initiation and/or maintenance is often difficult to determine. Genetically engineered mouse models that faithfully mimic lymphoma-associated genetic alterations represent valuable tools for elucidating the pathogenic roles of candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressors in vivo, as well as for the preclinical testing of novel therapeutic principles in an intact microenvironment. Here we summarize what has been learned about the mechanisms of oncogenic transformation from accurately modeling the most common and well-characterized genetic alterations identified in mature B-cell malignancies. This information is expected to guide the design of improved molecular diagnostics and mechanism-based therapeutic approaches for these diseases.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cell-intrinsic programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) has emerged as a tumor regulator in an immunity-independent manner, but its precise role in modulating tumor behaviors is complex, and how PD-1 is regulated in cancer cells is largely unknown. Here, we identified PD-1 as a direct target of tumor suppressor p53. Notably, p53 acetylation at K120/164 played a critical role in p53-mediated PD-1 transcription. Acetylated p53 preferentially recruited acetyltransferase cofactors onto PD-1 promoter, selectively facilitating PD-1 transcription by enhancing local chromatin acetylation. Reexpression of PD-1 in cancer cells inhibited tumor growth, whereas depletion of cancer cell-intrinsic PD-1 compromised p53-dependent tumor suppression. Moreover, histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) activated PD-1 in an acetylated p53-dependent manner, supporting a synergistic effect by HDACi and p53 on tumor suppression via stimulating cancer cell-intrinsic PD-1. Our study reveals a mechanism for activating cancer cell-intrinsic PD-1 and indicates that p53-mediated PD-1 activation is critically involved in tumor suppression in an immunity-independent manner.",

Cancer cells rewire cellular metabolism to meet the energetic and substrate demands of tumor development. It is well established that p53 suppresses glycolysis and promotes mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation through a number of downstream targets against the Warburg effect. The role of p53-mediated metabolic regulation in tumor suppression is complexed by its function to promote both cell survival and cell death under different physiological settings. Indeed, p53 can regulate both pro-oxidant and antioxidant target genes for complete opposite effects. In this review, we will summarize the roles of p53 in the regulation of glucose, lipid, amino acid, nucleotide, iron metabolism, and ROS production. We will highlight the mechanisms underlying p53-mediated ferroptosis, AKT/mTOR signaling as well as autophagy and discuss the complexity of p53-metabolic regulation in tumor development.",

    "abstract": "Sex difference in adiposity has long been recognized but the mechanism remains incompletely understood. Previous studies suggested that adiposity was regulated by autophagy in response to energy status change. Here, we show that the energy sensor Sirt1 mediates sex difference in adiposity by regulating autophagy and adipogenesis in partnership with estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1). Autophagy and adipogenesis were suppressed by Sirt1 activation or overexpression, which was associated with reduced sex difference in adiposity. Mechanistically, Sirt1 deacetylated and activated AKT and STAT3, resulting in suppression of autophagy and adipogenesis via mTOR-ULK1 and p55 cascades. ER\u03b1 induced Sirt1 expression and inhibited autophagy in adipocytes, while silencing Sirt1 reversed the effects of ER\u03b1 on autophagy and promoted adipogenesis. Moreover, Sirt1 deacetylated ER\u03b1, which constituted a positive feedback loop in the regulation of autophagy and adiposity. Our results revealed a new mechanism of Sirt1 regulating autophagy in adipocytes and shed light on sex difference in adiposity.",

    "abstract": "Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase is a master regulator of the DNA damage response, and loss of ATM leads to primary immunodeficiency and greatly increased risk for lymphoid malignancies. The FATC domain is conserved in phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-related protein kinases (PIKKs). Truncation mutation in the FATC domain (R3047X) selectively compromised reactive oxygen species-induced ATM activation in cell-free assays. In this article, we show that in mouse models, knock-in ATM-R3057X mutation (                 Atm                \u2060                  RX                 \u2060, corresponding to R3047X in human ATM) severely compromises ATM protein stability and causes T cell developmental defects, B cell Ig class-switch recombination defects, and infertility resembling ATM-null. The residual ATM-R3057X protein retains minimal yet functional measurable DNA damage-induced checkpoint activation and significantly delays lymphomagenesis in                 Atm                \u2060                  RX/RX                 \u2060 mice compared with                 Atm                \u2060                  -/-                 \u2060. Together, these results support a physiological role of the FATC domain in ATM protein stability and show that the presence of minimal residual ATM-R3057X protein can prevent growth retardation and delay tumorigenesis without restoring lymphocyte development and fertility.",

    "abstract": "As the clinical failure of glioblastoma treatment is attributed by multiple components, including myelin-associated infiltration, assessment of the molecular mechanisms underlying such process and identification of the infiltrating cells have been the primary objectives in glioblastoma research. Here, we adopted radiogenomic analysis to screen for functionally relevant genes that orchestrate the process of glioma cell infiltration through myelin and promote glioblastoma aggressiveness. The receptor of the Nogo ligand (NgR1) was selected as the top candidate through Differentially Expressed Genes (DEG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. Gain and loss of function studies on NgR1 elucidated its underlying molecular importance in suppressing myelin-associated infiltration in vitro and in vivo. The migratory ability of glioblastoma cells on myelin is reversibly modulated by NgR1 during differentiation and dedifferentiation process through deubiquitinating activity of USP1, which inhibits the degradation of ID1 to downregulate NgR1 expression. Furthermore, pimozide, a well-known antipsychotic drug, upregulates NgR1 by post-translational targeting of USP1, which sensitizes glioma stem cells to myelin inhibition and suppresses myelin-associated infiltration in vivo. In primary human glioblastoma, downregulation of NgR1 expression is associated with highly infiltrative characteristics and poor survival. Together, our findings reveal that loss of NgR1 drives myelin-associated infiltration of glioblastoma and suggest that novel therapeutic strategies aimed at reactivating expression of NgR1 will improve the clinical outcome of glioblastoma patients.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) plays a key role in cancer progression and is tightly regulated by the proteasome pathway. E3 ligases that mediate NRF2 ubiquitination have been widely reported, but the mechanism of NRF2 deubiquitination remains largely unclear. Here, we identified ubiquitin-specific-processing protease 11 (USP11) in NRF2 complexes and confirmed an interaction between these two proteins. We further found that USP11 deubiquitinates NRF2; this modification stabilizes NRF2. Functionally, USP11 depletion contributes to the suppression of cell proliferation and induction of ferroptotic cell death due to ROS-mediated stress, which can be largely abrogated by overexpression of NRF2. Finally, immunohistochemical staining of USP11 and NRF2 was performed using a lung tissue microarray, which revealed that USP11 is highly expressed in patients with NSCLC and positively correlated with NRF2 expression. Together, USP11 stabilizes NRF2 and is thus an important player in cell proliferation and ferroptosis.",

    "title": "Robust p53 Stabilization Is Dispensable for Its Activation and Tumor Suppressor Function",
    "abstract": "p53 is a short-lived protein with low basal levels under normal homeostasis conditions. However, upon DNA damage, levels of p53 dramatically increase for its activation. Although robust stabilization of p53 serves as a \"trademark\" for DNA damage responses, the requirement for such dramatic protein stabilization in tumor suppression has not been well addressed. Here we generated a mutant                 p53                   KQ                 mouse where all the C-terminal domain lysine residues were mutated to glutamines (K to Q mutations at K367, K369, K370, K378, K379, K383, and K384) to mimic constitutive acetylation of the p53 C-terminus. Because of p53 activation,                 p53                   KQ/KQ                 mice were perinatal lethal, yet this lethality was averted in                 p53                   KQ/-                 mice, which displayed normal postnatal development. Nevertheless,                 p53                   KQ/-                 mice died prematurely due to anemia and hematopoiesis failure. Further analyses indicated that expression of the acetylation-mimicking p53 mutant                 in vivo                induces activation of p53 targets in various tissues without obviously increasing p53 levels. In the well-established pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) mouse model, expression of the acetylation-mimicking p53-mutant protein effectively suppressed K-Ras-induced PDAC development in the absence of robust p53 stabilization. Together, our results provide proof-of-principle evidence that p53-mediated transcriptional function and tumor suppression can be achieved independently of its robust stabilization and reveal an alternative approach to activate p53 function for therapeutic purposes. SIGNIFICANCE: Although robust p53 stabilization is critical for acute p53 responses such as DNA damage, this study underscores the important role of low basal p53 protein levels in p53 activation and tumor suppression.",

    "abstract": "ABIN-1, also called TNIP1, is an ubiquitin-binding protein that serves an important role in suppressing RIPK1-independent apoptosis, necroptosis, and NF-\u03baB activation. However, the involvement of ABIN-1 in the regulation of RIPK1-dependent apoptosis (RDA) is unknown. In this study, we found that poly(I:C)\u2009+\u2009TAK1 inhibitor 5Z-7-oxozeaenol (P5) concurrently induces RDA and necroptosis in Abin-1                 -/-                , but not in Abin-1                 +/+                mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Upon P5 stimulation, cells initially die by necroptosis and subsequently by RDA. Furthermore, we explored the therapeutic effect of ABIN-1 deficiency in necroptosis-based cancer therapy in colorectal cancer (CRC). We found that poly(I:C)\u2009+\u20095Z-7-oxozeaenol\u2009+\u2009IDN-6556 (P5I) yields a robust pro-necroptosis response, and ABIN-1 deficiency additionally enhances this P5I-induced necroptosis. Moreover, phase I/II cIAP inhibitor birinapant with clinical caspase inhibitor IDN-6556 (BI) alone and 5-fluorouracil with IDN-6556 (FI) alone are sufficient to induce necroptotic cell death in CRC cells by promoting auto-secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF); ABIN-1 deficiency amplifies the BI- or FI-induced necroptosis. Two independent xenograft experiments using HT-29 or COLO205 cells show that both BI and P5I remarkably inhibit tumor growth via necroptosis activation. For poly(I:C)-induced cell death, the sensitizing effect of ABIN-1 deficiency on cell death may be attributed to increased expression of TLR3. In TNF-induced necroptosis, ABIN-1 deficiency increases TNF-induced RIPK1 polyubiquitination by reducing the recruitment of ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20 to the TNFR1 signaling complex and induces more TNF secretion in CRC cells upon pro-necroptosis stimulation. With this combined data, ABIN-1 deficiency promotes greater sensitization of CRC cells to necroptosis.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells develop strong genetic dependencies, enabling survival under oncogenic stress. MYC is a key oncogene activated across most cancers, and identifying associated synthetic lethality or sickness can provide important clues about its activity and potential therapeutic strategies. On the basis of previously conducted genome-wide screenings in MCF10A cells expressing MYC fused to an estrogen receptor fragment, we identified UVSSA, a gene involved in transcription-coupled repair, whose knockdown or knockout decreased cell viability when combined with MYC expression. Synthetic sick interactions between MYC expression and UVSSA down-regulation correlated with ATM/CHK2 activation, suggesting increased genome instability. We show that the synthetic sick interaction is diminished by attenuating RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) activity; yet, it is independent of UV-induced damage repair, suggesting that UVSSA has a critical function in regulating RNAPII in the absence of exogenous DNA damage. Supporting this hypothesis, RNAPII ChIP-seq revealed that MYC-dependent increases in RNAPII promoter occupancy are reduced or abrogated by UVSSA knockdown, suggesting that UVSSA influences RNAPII dynamics during MYC-dependent transcription. Taken together, our data show that the UVSSA complex has a significant function in supporting MYC-dependent RNAPII dynamics and maintaining cell survival during MYC addiction. While the role of UVSSA in regulating RNAPII has been documented thus far only in the context of UV-induced DNA damage repair, we propose that its activity is also required to cope with transcriptional changes induced by oncogene activation.",

Current interaction models and pathways, however, lack context specificity and are not oncoprotein specific. We introduce SigMaps as context-specific networks, comprising modulators, effectors and cognate binding-partners of a specific oncoprotein. SigMaps are reconstructed de novo by integrating diverse evidence sources-including protein structure, gene expression and mutational profiles-via the OncoSig machine learning framework. We first generated a KRAS-specific SigMap for lung adenocarcinoma, which recapitulated published KRAS biology, identified novel synthetic lethal proteins that were experimentally validated in three-dimensional spheroid models and established uncharacterized crosstalk with RAB/RHO. To show that OncoSig is generalizable, we first inferred SigMaps for the ten most mutated human oncoproteins and then for the full repertoire of 715 proteins in the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census. Taken together, these SigMaps show that the cell's regulatory and signaling architecture is highly tissue specific.",

    "abstract": "The transcriptomic classification of glioblastoma (GBM) has failed to predict survival and therapeutic vulnerabilities. A computational approach for unbiased identification of core biological traits of single cells and bulk tumors uncovered four tumor cell states and GBM subtypes distributed along neurodevelopmental and metabolic axes, classified as proliferative/progenitor, neuronal, mitochondrial and glycolytic/plurimetabolic. Each subtype was enriched with biologically coherent multiomic features. Mitochondrial GBM was associated with the most favorable clinical outcome. It relied exclusively on oxidative phosphorylation for energy production, whereas the glycolytic/plurimetabolic subtype was sustained by aerobic glycolysis and amino acid and lipid metabolism. Deletion of the glucose-proton symporter                 SLC45A1                was the truncal alteration most significantly associated with mitochondrial GBM, and the reintroduction of SLC45A1 in mitochondrial glioma cells induced acidification and loss of fitness. Mitochondrial, but not glycolytic/plurimetabolic, GBM exhibited marked vulnerability to inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation. The pathway-based classification of GBM informs survival and enables precision targeting of cancer metabolism.",

    "title": "The Cancer-Associated ATM R3008H Mutation Reveals the Link between ATM Activation and Its Exchange",
    "abstract": "ATM kinase is a tumor suppressor and a master regulator of the DNA damage response. Most cancer-associated alterations to ATM are missense mutations at the PI3-kinase regulatory domain (PRD) or the kinase domain. Expression of kinase-dead (KD) ATM protein solely accelerates lymphomagenesis beyond ATM loss. To understand how PRD suppresses lymphomagenesis, we introduced the cancer-associated PRD mutation R3008H (R3016 in mouse) into mice. R3008H abrogated DNA damage- and oxidative stress-induced activation of ATM without consistently affecting ATM protein stability and recruitment. In contrast to the early embryonic lethality of                 Atm                   KD/KD                 mice, AtmR3016H (                 Atm                   R/R                 ) mice were viable, immunodeficient, and displayed spontaneous craniofacial abnormalities and delayed lymphomagenesis compared with                 Atm                   -/-                 controls. Mechanistically, R3008H rescued the tardy exchange of ATM-KD at DNA damage foci, indicating that PRD coordinates ATM activation with its exchange at DNA-breaks. Taken together, our results reveal a unique tumorigenesis profile for PRD mutations that is distinct from null or KD mutations. SIGNIFICANT: This study functionally characterizes the most common ATM missense mutation R3008H in cancer and identifies a unique role of PI3-kinase regulatory domain in ATM activation.",

Despite a generally favorable response to immunochemotherapy regimens, a fraction of patients does not respond or relapses early with unfavorable prognosis. For the vast majority of those who initially respond, relapses will repeatedly occur with increasing refractoriness to available treatments. Addressing the clinical challenges in FL warrants deep understanding of the nature of treatment-resistant FL cells seeding relapses, and of the biological basis of early disease progression. Great progress has been made in the last decade in the description and interrogation of the (epi)genomic landscape of FL cells, of their major dependency to the tumor microenvironment (TME), and of the stepwise lymphomagenesis process, from healthy to subclinical disease and to overt FL. A new picture is emerging, in which an ever-evolving tumor-TME duo sparks a complex and multilayered clonal and functional heterogeneity, blurring the discovery of prognostic biomarkers, patient stratification and reliable designs of risk-adapted treatments. Novel technological approaches allowing to decipher both tumor and TME heterogeneity at the single-cell level are beginning to unravel unsuspected cell dynamics and plasticity of FL cells. The upcoming drawing of a comprehensive functional picture of FL within its ecosystem holds great promise to address the unmet medical needs of this complex lymphoma.",

    "abstract": "Based on gene expression profiles, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is sub-divided into germinal center B cell-like (GCB) and activated B cell-like (ABC) DLBCL. Two of the most common genomic aberrations in ABC-DLBCL are mutations in                 MYD88                , as well as                 BCL2                copy number gains. Here, we employ immune phenotyping, RNA-Seq and whole exome sequencing to characterize a                 Myd88                and                 Bcl2                -driven mouse model of ABC-DLBCL. We show that this model resembles features of human ABC-DLBCL. We further demonstrate an actionable dependence of our murine ABC-DLBCL model on BCL2. This BCL2 dependence was also detectable in human ABC-DLBCL cell lines. Moreover, human ABC-DLBCLs displayed increased                 PD-L1                expression, compared to GCB-DLBCL.

    "abstract": "Here, we showed that the acetylation-defective                 p53-4KR                mice, lacking the ability of cell cycle arrest, senescence, apoptosis, and ferroptosis, were tumor prone but failed to develop early-onset tumors. By identifying a novel p53 acetylation site at lysine K136, we found that simultaneous mutations at all five acetylation sites (p53-5KR) diminished its remaining tumor suppression function. Moreover, the embryonic lethality caused by the deficiency of                 mdm2                was fully rescued in the background of                 p53                   5KR/5KR                 , but not                 p53                   4KR/4KR                 background. p53-4KR retained the ability to suppress mTOR function but this activity was abolished in                 p53-5KR                cells.

Here we describe the application of cell-free extracts derived from Xenopus eggs as a model system to investigate signaling from DNA damage, modulation of DNA replication, checkpoint activation, and ultimately DNA repair. We outline the preparation of cell-free extracts, DNA substrates, and their subsequent use in assays aimed at understanding the cellular response to DNA damage.

    "abstract": "Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) and peripheral T cell lymphoma not-otherwise-specified (PTCL, NOS) have poor prognosis and lack driver actionable targets for directed therapies in most cases. Here we identify                 FYN-TRAF3IP2                as a recurrent oncogenic gene fusion in AITL and PTCL, NOS tumors. Mechanistically, we show that FYN-TRAF3IP2 leads to aberrant NF-\u03baB signaling downstream of T cell receptor activation. Consistent with a driver oncogenic role, FYN-TRAF3IP2 expression in hematopoietic progenitors induces NF-\u03baB-driven T cell transformation in mice and cooperates with loss of the                 Tet2                tumor suppressor in PTCL development. Moreover, abrogation of NF-\u03baB signaling in                 FYN-TRAF3IP2                -induced tumors with I\u03baB kinase inhibitors delivers strong anti-lymphoma effects                 in vitro                and                 in vivo                .

    "abstract": "We report a comprehensive proteogenomics analysis, including whole-genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and proteomics and phosphoproteomics profiling, of 218 tumors across 7 histological types of childhood brain cancer: low-grade glioma (n\u00a0= 93), ependymoma (32), high-grade glioma (25), medulloblastoma (22), ganglioglioma (18), craniopharyngioma (16), and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (12). Proteomics data identify common biological themes that span histological boundaries, suggesting that treatments used for one histological type may be applied effectively to other tumors sharing similar proteomics features. Immune landscape characterization reveals diverse tumor microenvironments across and within diagnoses. Proteomics data further reveal functional effects of somatic mutations and copy number variations (CNVs) not evident in transcriptomics data. Kinase-substrate association and co-expression network analysis identify important biological mechanisms of tumorigenesis. This is the first large-scale proteogenomics analysis across traditional histological boundaries to uncover foundational pediatric brain tumor biology and inform rational treatment selection.",

Tumor cells with stem-like properties preferentially survive radiation and give rise to glioma recurrence. Various techniques for enriching and quantifying cells with stem-like properties have been used, including the fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)-based side population (SP) assay, which is a functional assay that enriches for stem-like tumor cells. In these analyses, mouse models of glioma have been used to understand the biology of this disease and therapeutic responses, including the radiation response. We present combined SP analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing of genetically-engineered mouse models of glioma to show a time course of cellular response to radiation. We identify and characterize two distinct tumor cell populations that are inherently radioresistant and also distinct effects of radiation on immune cell populations within the tumor microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "The nuclear receptor-binding SET domain (NSD) family of histone methyltransferases is associated with various malignancies, including aggressive acute leukemia with NUP98-NSD1 translocation. While NSD proteins represent attractive drug targets, their catalytic SET domains exist in autoinhibited conformation, presenting notable challenges for inhibitor development. Here, we employed a fragment-based screening strategy followed by chemical optimization, which resulted in the development of the first-in-class irreversible small-molecule inhibitors of the nuclear receptor-binding SET domain protein 1 (NSD1) SET domain. The crystal structure of NSD1 in complex with covalently bound ligand reveals a conformational change in the autoinhibitory loop of the SET domain and formation of a channel-like pocket suitable for targeting with small molecules. Our covalent lead-compound BT5-demonstrates on-target activity in NUP98-NSD1 leukemia cells, including inhibition of histone H3 lysine 36 dimethylation and downregulation of target genes, and impaired colony formation in an NUP98-NSD1 patient sample. This study will facilitate the development of the next generation of potent and selective inhibitors of the NSD histone methyltransferases.",

We introduce improved optically decodable mRNA capture beads and implement a more scalable and simplified optical decoding process. We demonstrate the utility of SCOPE-seq2 for fluorescence, morphological, and expression profiling of individual primary cells from a human glioblastoma (GBM) surgical sample, revealing relationships between simple imaging features and cellular identity, particularly among malignantly transformed tumor cells.",

Still, patients with primary refractory disease or with relapsed leukemia have a very poor prognosis. Here we integrate an in-depth dissection of the mutational landscape across diagnostic and relapsed pediatric and adult ALL samples with genome-wide CRISPR screen analysis of gene-drug interactions across seven ALL chemotherapy drugs. By combining these analyses, we uncover diagnostic and relapse-specific mutational mechanisms as well as genetic drivers of chemoresistance. Functionally, our data identifies common and drug-specific pathways modulating chemotherapy response and underscores the effect of drug combinations in restricting the selection of resistance-driving genetic lesions. In addition, by identifying actionable targets for the reversal of chemotherapy resistance, these analyses open novel therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of relapse and refractory disease.",

    "abstract": "To generate antibodies with different effector functions, B cells undergo Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain (IgH) class switch recombination (CSR). The ligation step of CSR is usually mediated by the classical nonhomologous end-joining (cNHEJ) pathway. In cNHEJ-deficient cells, a remarkable \u223c25% of CSR can be achieved by the alternative end-joining (Alt-EJ) pathway that preferentially uses microhomology (MH) at the junctions. While A-EJ-mediated repair of endonuclease-generated breaks requires DNA end resection, we show that CtIP-mediated DNA end resection is dispensable for A-EJ-mediated CSR using cNHEJ-deficient B cells. High-throughput sequencing analyses revealed that loss of ATM/ATR phosphorylation of CtIP at T855 or ATM kinase inhibition suppresses resection without altering the MH pattern of the A-EJ-mediated switch junctions. Moreover, we found that ATM kinase promotes Alt-EJ-mediated CSR by suppressing interchromosomal translocations independent of end resection. Finally, temporal analyses reveal that MHs are enriched in early internal deletions even in cNHEJ-proficient B cells. Thus, we propose that repetitive IgH switch regions represent favored substrates for MH-mediated end-joining contributing to the robustness and resection independence of A-EJ-mediated CSR.",

    "abstract": "Metastasis arises when cancer cells disseminate from their site of origin and invade distant organs. While cancer cells rarely colonize muscle, they often induce a debilitating muscle-wasting condition known as cachexia that compromises feeding, breathing, and cardiac function in metastatic cancer patients. In fact, nearly 80% of metastatic cancer patients experience a spectrum of muscle-wasting states, which deteriorates the quality of life and overall survival of cancer patients. Muscle wasting in cancer results from increased muscle catabolism induced by circulating tumor factors and a systemic metabolic dysfunction. In addition, muscle loss can be exacerbated by the exposure to antineoplastic therapies and the process of aging. With no approved therapies to alleviate cachexia, muscle health, therefore, becomes a key determinant of prognosis, treatment response, and survival in metastatic cancer patients. This review will discuss the current understanding of cancer-associated cachexia and highlight promising therapeutic strategies to treat muscle wasting in the context of metastatic cancers.",

While the programmed DNA cleavage events are initiated by lymphocyte-specific factors, the resulting DNA double-strand break (DSB) intermediates activate the ATM kinase-mediated DNA damage response (DDR) and rely on the ubiquitously expressed classical non-homologous end-joining (cNHEJ) pathway including the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), and, in the case of CSR, also the alternative end-joining (Alt-EJ) pathway, for repair. Correspondingly, patients and animal models with cNHEJ or DDR defects develop distinct types of immunodeficiency reflecting their specific DNA repair deficiency. The unique end-structure, sequence context, and cell cycle regulation of V(D)J recombination and CSR also provide a valuable platform to study the mechanisms of, and the interplay between, cNHEJ and DDR. Here, we compare and contrast the genetic consequences of DNA repair defects in V(D)J recombination and CSR with a focus on the newly discovered cNHEJ factors and the kinase-dependent structural roles of ATM and DNA-PK in animal models. Throughout, we try to highlight the pending questions and emerging differences that will extend our understanding of cNHEJ and DDR in the context of primary immunodeficiency and lymphoid malignancies.",

To understand the molecular nature of 'trapping' in cells, we employed quantitative live-cell imaging and fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching. Unexpectedly, we found that PARP1 exchanges rapidly at DNA damage sites even in the presence of clinical PARPi, suggesting the persistent foci are not caused by physical stalling. Loss of Xrcc1, a major downstream effector of PAR, also caused persistent PARP1 foci without affecting PARP1 exchange. Thus, we propose that the persistent PARP1 foci are formed by different PARP1 molecules that are continuously recruited to and exchanging at DNA lesions due to attenuated XRCC1-LIG3 recruitment and delayed DNA repair. Moreover, mutation analyses of the NAD+ interacting residues of PARP1 showed that PARP1 can be physically trapped at DNA damage sites, and identified H862 as a potential regulator for PARP1 exchange. PARP1-H862D, but not PARylation-deficient PARP1-E988K, formed stable PARP1 foci upon activation. Together, these findings uncovered the nature of persistent PARP1 foci and identified NAD+ interacting residues involved in the PARP1 exchange.",

    "abstract": "The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), which is composed of the KU heterodimer and the large catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), is a classical nonhomologous end-joining (cNHEJ) factor. Na\u00efve B cells undergo class switch recombination (CSR) to generate antibodies with different isotypes by joining two DNA double-strand breaks at different switching regions via the cNHEJ pathway. DNA-PK and the cNHEJ pathway play important roles in the DNA repair phase of CSR. To initiate cNHEJ, KU binds to DNA ends and recruits and activates DNA-PK. Activated DNA-PK phosphorylates DNA-PKcs at the S2056 and T2609 clusters. Loss of T2609 cluster phosphorylation increases radiation sensitivity but whether T2609 phosphorylation has a role in physiological DNA repair remains elusive. Using the                 DNA-PKcs                  5A                 mouse model carrying alanine substitutions at the T2609 cluster, here we show that loss of T2609 phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs does not affect the CSR efficiency.

    "abstract": "Notch activation is highly prevalent among cancers, in particular T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). However, the use of pan-Notch inhibitors to treat cancers has been hampered by adverse effects, particularly intestinal toxicities. To circumvent this barrier in T-ALL, we aimed to inhibit ETS1, a developmentally important T-cell transcription factor previously shown to co-bind Notch response elements. Using complementary genetic approaches in mouse models, we show that ablation of Ets1 leads to strong Notch-mediated suppressive effects on T-cell development and leukemogenesis, but milder intestinal effects than pan-Notch inhibitors. Mechanistically, genome-wide chromatin profiling studies demonstrate that Ets1 inactivation impairs recruitment of multiple Notch-associated factors and Notch-dependent activation of transcriptional elements controlling major Notch-driven oncogenic effector pathways. These results uncover previously unrecognized hierarchical heterogeneity of Notch-controlled genes and points to Ets1-mediated enucleation of Notch-Rbpj transcriptional complexes as a target for developing specific anti-Notch therapies in T-ALL that circumvent the barriers of pan-Notch inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Nearly 80% of advanced cancer patients are afflicted with cachexia, a debilitating syndrome characterized by extensive loss of muscle mass and function. Cachectic cancer patients have a reduced tolerance to antineoplastic therapies and often succumb to premature death from the wasting of respiratory and cardiac muscles. Since there are no available treatments for cachexia, it is imperative to understand the mechanisms that drive cachexia in order to devise effective strategies to treat it. Although 25% of metastatic breast cancer patients develop symptoms of muscle wasting, mechanistic studies of breast cancer cachexia have been hampered by a lack of experimental models. Using tumor cells deficient for BARD1, a subunit of the BRCA1/BARD1 tumor suppressor complex, we have developed a new orthotopic model of triple-negative breast cancer that spontaneously metastasizes to the lung and leads to systemic muscle deterioration. We show that expression of the metal-ion transporter, Zip14, is markedly upregulated in cachectic muscles from these mice and is associated with elevated intramuscular zinc and iron levels. Aberrant Zip14 expression and altered metal-ion homeostasis could therefore represent an underlying mechanism of cachexia development in human patients with triple-negative breast cancer. Our study provides a unique model for studying breast cancer cachexia and identifies a potential therapeutic target for its treatment.",

    "abstract": "Programmed DNA recombination in mammalian cells occurs predominantly in a directional manner. While random DNA breaks are typically repaired both by deletion and by inversion at approximately equal proportions, V(D)J and class switch recombination (CSR) of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene overwhelmingly delete intervening sequences to yield productive rearrangement. What factors channel chromatin breaks to deletional CSR in lymphocytes is unknown. Integrating CRISPR knockout and chemical perturbation screening we here identify the Snf2-family helicase-like ERCC6L2 as one such factor. We show that ERCC6L2 promotes double-strand break end-joining and facilitates optimal CSR in mice. At the\u00a0cellular levels, ERCC6L2 rapidly engages in DNA repair through its C-terminal domains. Mechanistically, ERCC6L2 interacts with other end-joining factors and plays a functionally redundant role with the XLF end-joining factor in V(D)J recombination. Strikingly, ERCC6L2 controls orientation-specific joining of broken ends during CSR, which relies on its helicase activity. Thus, ERCC6L2 facilitates programmed recombination through directional repair of distant breaks.",

Ubiquitination and degradation of WRN have been reported, however, the E3 ubiquitin ligase of WRN is little known. Here, we identify mindbomb E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (MIB1) as a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase for WRN protein. MIB1 physically interacts with WRN in vitro and in vivo and induces ubiquitination and degradation of WRN in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Camptothecin (CPT) enhances the interaction between MIB1 and WRN, and promotes WRN degradation in a MIB1-dependent manner. In addition, CPT-induced cellular senescence is facilitated by the expression of MIB1 and attenuated by WRN expression. Our results show that MIB1-mediated degradation of WRN promotes cellular senescence and reveal a novel model executed by MIB1 and WRN to regulate cellular senescence.",

We show that DNA polymerase \u03b1 (Pol \u03b1), which synthesizes short primers for DNA synthesis, binds histone H3-H4 preferentially. A Pol \u03b1 mutant defective in histone binding in vitro impairs the transfer of parental H3-H4 to lagging strands in both yeast and mouse ES cells. Last, dysregulation of both coding genes and noncoding endogenous retroviruses is detected in mutant ES cells defective in parental histone transfer.

Studying the mechanism underlying growth augmentation is expected to improve clinical therapies. The ovarian tumor (OTU) subfamily deubiquitinases have been implicated in the regulation of critical cell-signaling cascades, but most OTUs functions remain to be investigated. Through an unbiased RNAi screen, knockdown of OTUD5 is shown to significantly accelerate cell growth. Further investigation reveals that OTUD5 depletion leads to the enhanced transcriptional activity of TRIM25 and the inhibited expression of PML by altering the ubiquitination level of TRIM25. Importantly, OTUD5 knockdown accelerates tumor growth in a nude mouse model. OTUD5 expression is markedly downregulated in tumor tissues. The reduced OTUD5 level is associated with an aggressive phenotype and a poor clinical outcome for cancers patients. Our findings reveal a mechanism whereby OTUD5 regulates gene transcription and suppresses tumorigenesis by deubiquitinating TRIM25, providing a potential target for oncotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Activation of dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinases 1A and 1B (DYRK1A and DYRK1B) requires prolyl hydroxylation by PHD1 prolyl hydroxylase. Prolyl hydroxylation of DYRK1 initiates a cascade of events leading to the release of molecular constraints on von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) ubiquitin ligase tumor suppressor function. However, the proline residue of DYRK1 targeted by hydroxylation and the role of prolyl hydroxylation in tyrosine autophosphorylation of DYRK1 are unknown. We found that a highly conserved proline in the CMGC insert of the DYRK1 kinase domain is hydroxylated by PHD1, and this event precedes tyrosine autophosphorylation. Mutation of the hydroxylation acceptor proline precludes tyrosine autophosphorylation and folding of DYRK1, resulting in a kinase unable to preserve VHL function and lacking glioma suppression activity. The consensus proline sequence is shared by most CMGC kinases, and prolyl hydroxylation is essential for catalytic activation. Thus, formation of prolyl-hydroxylated intermediates is a novel mechanism of kinase maturation and likely a general mechanism of regulation of CMGC kinases in eukaryotes.",

We combined single-cell RNA-seq with multi-sector biopsies to sample and analyze single-cell expression profiles of gliomas from 13 Chinese patients. After classifying individual cells, we generated a spatial and temporal landscape of glioma that revealed the patterns of invasion between the different sub-regions of gliomas. We also used single-cell inferred copy number variations and pseudotime trajectories to inform on the crucial branches that dominate tumor progression. The dynamic cell components of the multi-region biopsy analysis allowed us to spatially deconvolute with unprecedented accuracy the transcriptomic features of the core and those of the periphery of glioma at single-cell level. Through this rich and geographically detailed dataset, we were also able to characterize and construct the chemokine and chemokine receptor interactions that exist among different tumor and non-tumor cells. This study provides the first spatial-level analysis of the cellular states that characterize human gliomas. It also presents an initial molecular map of the cross-talks between glioma cells and the surrounding microenvironment with single-cell resolution.",

    "title": "Genomic characterization of HIV-associated plasmablastic lymphoma identifies pervasive mutations in the JAK-STAT pathway",
    "abstract": "Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is an aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma associated with immunodeficiency in the context of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection or iatrogenic immunosuppression. While a rare disease in general, the incidence is dramatically increased in regions of the world with high HIV prevalence. The molecular pathogenesis of this disease is poorly characterized. Here, we defined the genomic features of PBL in a cohort of 110 patients from South Africa (15 by whole exome sequencing and 95 by deep targeted sequencing). We identified recurrent mutations in genes of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, including                 STAT3                (42%),                 JAK1                (14%) and                 SOCS1                (10%), leading to its constitutive activation. Moreover, 24% of cases harbored gain-of-function mutations in RAS family members (                 NRAS                and                 KRAS                ). Comparative analysis with other B-cell malignancies uncovered PBL-specific somatic mutations and transcriptional programs. We also found recurrent copy number gains encompassing the CD44 gene (37%), which encodes for a cell surface receptor involved in lymphocyte activation and homing, and was found expressed at high levels in all tested cases, independent of genetic alterations. These findings have implications for the understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease and the development of personalized medicine approaches.",

    "abstract": "The interplay between glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promotes progression of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). However, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the relationship between these two cell types remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that ARS2 (arsenite-resistance protein 2), a zinc finger protein that is essential for early mammalian development, plays critical roles in GSC maintenance and M2-like TAM polarization. ARS2 directly activates its novel transcriptional target MGLL, encoding monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), to regulate the self-renewal and tumorigenicity of GSCs through production of prostaglandin E                 2                (PGE                 2                ), which stimulates \u03b2-catenin activation of GSC and M2-like TAM polarization. We identify M2-like signature downregulated by which MAGL-specific inhibitor, JZL184, increased survival rate significantly in the mouse xenograft model by blocking PGE                 2                production. Taken together, our results suggest that blocking the interplay between GSCs and TAMs by targeting ARS2/MAGL signaling offers a potentially novel therapeutic option for GBM patients.",

    "title": "Mutations in the RNA Splicing Factor SF3B1 Promote Tumorigenesis through MYC Stabilization",
    "abstract": "Although mutations in the gene encoding the RNA splicing factor SF3B1 are frequent in multiple cancers, their functional effects and therapeutic dependencies are poorly understood. Here, we characterize 98 tumors and 12 isogenic cell lines harboring                 SF3B1                hotspot mutations, identifying hundreds of cryptic 3' splice sites common and specific to different cancer types. Regulatory network analysis revealed that the most common                 SF3B1                mutation activates MYC via effects conserved across human and mouse cells.                 SF3B1                mutations promote decay of transcripts encoding the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) subunit PPP2R5A, increasing MYC S62 and BCL2 S70 phosphorylation which, in turn, promotes MYC protein stability and impair apoptosis, respectively. Genetic PPP2R5A restoration or pharmacologic PP2A activation impaired SF3B1-mutant tumorigenesis, elucidating a therapeutic approach to aberrant splicing by mutant SF3B1. SIGNIFICANCE: Here, we identify that mutations in                 SF3B1                , the most commonly mutated splicing factor gene across cancers, alter splicing of a specific subunit of the PP2A serine/threonine phosphatase complex to confer post-translational MYC and BCL2 activation, which is therapeutically intervenable using an FDA-approved drug.

    "abstract": "Sirtuin 7 (SIRT7), an NAD                 +                -dependent deacetylase, plays vital roles in energy sensing, but the underlying mechanisms of action remain less clear. Here, we report that SIRT7 is required for p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest during glucose deprivation. We show that SIRT7 directly interacts with p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) and the affinity for this interaction increases during glucose deprivation. Upon binding, SIRT7 deacetylates PCAF at lysine 720 (K720), which augments PCAF binding to murine double minute (MDM2), the p53 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to accelerated MDM2 degradation. This effect results in upregulated expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor, p21                 Waf1/Cip1                , which further leads to cell-cycle arrest and decreased cell viability. These data highlight the importance of the SIRT7-PCAF interaction in regulating p53 activity and cell-cycle progression during conditions of glucose deprivation. This axis may represent a new avenue to design effective therapeutics based on tumor starvation.",

    "abstract": "Cell death is an essential feature of development in multicellular organisms, a critical driver of degenerative diseases, and can be harnessed for treating some cancers. Understanding the mechanisms governing cell death is critical for addressing its role in disease. Similarly, metabolism is essential for normal energy and biomolecule production, and goes awry in many diseases. Metabolism and cell death are tightly linked in the phenomenon of ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death driven by peroxidation of phospholipids. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) uses glutathione to protect cells from ferroptosis by eliminating phospholipid peroxides. Recent data have revealed glutathione/GPX4-independent axes for suppressing ferroptosis, and insight into the regulation of iron and mitochondria in ferroptosis. Ferroptosis has recently been implicated in multiple diseases, and functions as a tumor suppression mechanism. Ferroptosis induction is a promising approach in treating several conditions, including neoplastic diseases. Here, we summarize these recent advances.",

To fill the need for a simple, user-friendly, and inexpensive dosimeter, we designed an innovative colorimetric nanosensor-based assay for detecting ionizing radiation. We show that hydroxyl radicals generated by ionizing radiation can be used to etch gold nanorods (AuNRs) and silver nanoprisms (AgNPRs), yielding reproducible color changes for radiation dose detection in the range of 50-2000 rad, broad enough to cover doses used in hyperfractionated, conventional, and hypofractionated radiotherapy. This range of doses detected by this assay correlates with radiation-induced DNA damage response in mammalian cells. Furthermore, this AuNR- and AgNPR-based sensing platform has been established in a paper format that can be readily adopted for a wide range of applications and translation.",

    "abstract": "T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy that arises from transformation of T-cell primed hematopoietic progenitors. Although T-ALL is a heterogenous and molecularly complex disease, more than 65% of T-ALL patients carry activating mutations in the                 NOTCH1                gene. The majority of T-ALL-associated                 NOTCH1                mutations either disrupt the negative regulatory region, allowing signal activation in the absence of ligand binding, or result in truncation of the C-terminal PEST domain involved in the termination of NOTCH1 signaling by proteasomal degradation. To date, retroviral transduction models have relied heavily on the overexpression of aggressively truncated variants of                 NOTCH1                (such as ICN1 or \u0394E-NOTCH1), which result in supraphysiological levels of signaling activity and are rarely found in human T-ALL. The current protocol describes the method for mouse bone marrow isolation, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSC) enrichment, followed by retroviral transduction with an oncogenic mutant form of the NOTCH1 receptor (NOTCH1-L1601P-\u0394P) that closely resembles the gain-of-function mutations most commonly found in patient samples. A hallmark of this forced expression of constitutively active NOTCH1 is a transient wave of extrathymic immature T-cell development, which precedes oncogenic transformation to T-ALL. Furthermore, this approach models leukemic transformation and progression                 in vivo                by allowing for crosstalk between leukemia cells and the microenvironment, an aspect unaccounted for in cell-line based                 in vitro                studies. Thus, the HSC transduction and transplantation model more faithfully recapitulates development of the human disease, providing a highly comprehensive and versatile tool for further                 in vivo                and                 ex vivo                functional studies.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation to hypoxia is a common feature in solid tumors orchestrated by oxygen-dependent and independent upregulation of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1). We unveiled that G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK2), known to be overexpressed in certain tumors, fosters this hypoxic pathway via phosphorylation of the mRNA-binding protein HuR, a central HIF-1\u03b1 modulator. GRK2-mediated HuR phosphorylation increases the total levels and cytoplasmic shuttling of HuR in response to hypoxia, and GRK2-phosphodefective HuR mutants show defective cytosolic accumulation and lower binding to HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA in hypoxic Hela cells. Interestingly, enhanced GRK2 and HuR expression correlate in luminal breast cancer patients. GRK2 also promotes the HuR/HIF-1\u03b1 axis and VEGF-C accumulation in normoxic MCF7 breast luminal cancer cells and is required for the induction of HuR/HIF1-\u03b1 in response to adrenergic stress. Our results point to a relevant role of the GRK2/HuR/HIF-1\u03b1 module in the adaptation of malignant cells to tumor microenvironment-related stresses.",

These tumour-derived circulating factors also profoundly impact tissues that are rarely inhabited by metastatic cancer cells such as skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. In fact, the majority of patients with metastatic cancer develop a debilitating muscle-wasting syndrome, known as cachexia, that is associated with decreased tolerance to antineoplastic therapy, poor prognosis and accelerated death, with no approved treatments. In this Perspective, we discuss the development of cachexia in the context of metastatic progression. We briefly discuss how circulating factors either directly or indirectly promote cachexia development and examine how signals from the metastatic process can trigger and amplify this process. Finally, we highlight promising therapeutic opportunities for targeting cachexia in the context of metastatic cancers.",

In this work, we show that the import of oxidized cysteine (cystine) via system x                 C                 -                is a critical dependency of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which is a leading cause of cancer mortality. PDAC cells used cysteine to synthesize glutathione and coenzyme A, which, together, down-regulated ferroptosis. Studying genetically engineered mice, we found that the deletion of a system x                 C                 -                subunit,                 Slc7a11                , induced tumor-selective ferroptosis and inhibited PDAC growth. This was replicated through the administration of cyst(e)inase, a drug that depletes cysteine and cystine, demonstrating a translatable means to induce ferroptosis in PDAC.",

    "abstract": "The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), which comprises the KU heterodimer and a catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), is a classical non-homologous end-joining (cNHEJ) factor                 1                . KU binds to DNA ends, initiates cNHEJ, and recruits and activates DNA-PKcs. KU also binds to RNA, but the relevance of this interaction in mammals is unclear. Here we use mouse models to show that DNA-PK has an unexpected role in the biogenesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and in haematopoiesis. The expression of kinase-dead DNA-PKcs abrogates cNHEJ                 2                . However, most mice that both expressed kinase-dead DNA-PKcs and lacked the tumour suppressor TP53 developed myeloid disease, whereas all other previously characterized mice deficient in both cNHEJ and TP53 expression succumbed to pro-B cell lymphoma                 3                . DNA-PK autophosphorylates DNA-PKcs, which is its best characterized substrate. Blocking the phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at the T2609 cluster, but not the S2056 cluster, led to KU-dependent defects in 18S rRNA processing, compromised global protein synthesis in haematopoietic cells and caused bone marrow failure in mice. KU drives the assembly of DNA-PKcs on a wide range of cellular RNAs, including the U3 small nucleolar RNA, which is essential for processing of 18S rRNA                 4                . U3 activates purified DNA-PK and triggers phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at T2609. DNA-PK, but not other cNHEJ factors, resides in nucleoli in an rRNA-dependent manner and is co-purified with the small subunit processome. Together our data show that DNA-PK has RNA-dependent, cNHEJ-independent functions during ribosome biogenesis that require the kinase activity of DNA-PKcs and its phosphorylation at the T2609 cluster.",

    "abstract": "Alterations of the PALB2 tumor suppressor gene have been identified in familial breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancer cases. PALB2 cooperates with BRCA1/2 proteins through physical interaction in initiation of homologous recombination, in maintenance of genome integrity following DNA double-strand breaks. To determine if the role of PALB2 as a linker between BRCA1 and BRCA2 is critical for BRCA1/2-mediated tumor suppression, we generated Palb2 mouse pancreatic cancer models and compared tumor latencies, phenotypes and drug responses with previously generated Brca1/2 pancreatic cancer models. For development of Palb2 pancreatic cancer, we crossed conditional Palb2 null mouse with mice carrying the KrasG12D; p53R270H; Pdx1-Cre (KPC) constructs, and these animals were observed for pancreatic tumor development. Individual deletion of Palb2, Brca1 or Brca2 genes in pancreas per se using Pdx1-Cre was insufficient to cause tumors, but it reduced pancreata size. Concurrent expression of mutant KrasG12D and p53R270H, with tumor suppressor inactivated strains in Palb2-KPC, Brca1-KPC or Brca2-KPC, accelerated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) development. Moreover, most Brca1-KPC and some Palb2-KPC animals developed mucinous cystic neoplasms with PDAC, while Brca2-KPC and KPC animals did not. 26% of Palb2-KPC mice developed MCNs in pancreata, which resemble closely the Brca1 deficient tumors. However, the remaining 74% of Palb2-KPC animals developed PDACs without any cysts like Brca2 deficient tumors. In addition, the number of ADM lesions and immune cells infiltrations (CD3+ and F/480+) were significantly increased in Brca1-KPC tumors, but not in Brca2-KPC tumors. Interestingly, the level of ADM lesions and infiltration of CD3+ or F/480+ cells in Palb2-KPC tumors were intermediate between Brca1-KPC and Brca2-KPC tumors. As expected, disruption of Palb2 and Brca1/2 sensitized tumor cells to DNA damaging agents in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, Palb2-KPC PDAC exhibited features observed in both Brca1-KPC and Brca2-KPC tumors, which could be due to its role, as a linker between Brca1 and Brca2.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal cancer type in which the mortality rate approaches the incidence rate. More than 85% of PDAC patients experience a profound loss of muscle mass and function, known as cachexia. PDAC patients with this condition suffer from decreased tolerance to anti-cancer therapies and often succumb to premature death due to respiratory and cardiac muscle wasting. Yet, there are no approved therapies available to alleviate cachexia. We previously found that upregulation of the metal ion transporter,                 Zip14                , and altered zinc homeostasis are critical mediators of cachexia in metastatic colon, lung, and breast cancer models. Here, we show that a similar mechanism is likely driving the development of cachexia in PDAC. In two independent experimental metastasis models generated from the murine PDAC cell lines, Pan02 and FC1242, we observed aberrant                 Zip14                expression and increased zinc ion levels in cachectic muscles. Moreover, in advanced PDAC patients, high levels of ZIP14 in muscles correlated with the presence of cachexia. These studies underscore the importance of altered ZIP14 function in PDAC-associated cachexia development and highlight a potential therapeutic opportunity for improving the quality of life and prolonging survival in PDAC patients.",

Here we show that the histone chaperone Chromatin Assembly Factor 1 (CAF-1), which is recruited to DNA replication forks through its interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) for nucleosome assembly, participates in the establishment of H3K27me3-mediated silencing during differentiation. Deletion of CAF-1 p150 subunit impairs the silencing of many genes including Oct4,\u00a0Sox2 and Nanog as well as the establishment of H3K27me3 at these gene promoters during ESC differentiation. Mutations of PCNA residues involved in recruiting CAF-1 to the chromatin also result in defects in differentiation in vitro and impair early embryonic development as p150 deletion. Together, these results reveal that the CAF-1-PCNA nucleosome assembly pathway plays an important role in the establishment of H3K27me3-mediated silencing during cell fate determination.",

    "abstract": "Long-range enhancers govern the temporal and spatial control of gene expression; however, the mechanisms that regulate enhancer activity during normal and malignant development remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate a role for aberrant chromatin accessibility in the regulation of                 MYC                expression in T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Central to this process, the NOTCH1-                 MYC                enhancer (N-Me), a long-range T cell-specific                 MYC                enhancer, shows dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility during T-cell specification and maturation and an aberrant high degree of chromatin accessibility in mouse and human T-ALL cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that GATA3-driven nucleosome eviction dynamically modulates N-Me enhancer activity and is strictly required for NOTCH1-induced T-ALL initiation and maintenance. These results directly implicate aberrant regulation of chromatin accessibility at oncogenic enhancers as a mechanism of leukemic transformation. SIGNIFICANCE:                 MYC                is a major effector of NOTCH1 oncogenic programs in T-ALL. Here, we show a major role for GATA3-mediated enhancer nucleosome eviction as a driver of                 MYC                expression and leukemic transformation. These results support the role of aberrant chromatin accessibility and consequent oncogenic                 MYC                enhancer activation in NOTCH1-induced T-ALL.

    "abstract": "The evolutionary processes that drive universal therapeutic resistance in adult patients with diffuse glioma remain unclear                 1,2                . Here we analysed temporally separated DNA-sequencing data and matched clinical annotation from 222 adult patients with glioma. By analysing mutations and copy numbers across the three major subtypes of diffuse glioma, we found that driver genes detected at the initial stage of disease were retained at recurrence, whereas there was little evidence of recurrence-specific gene alterations. Treatment with alkylating agents resulted in a hypermutator phenotype at different rates across the glioma subtypes, and hypermutation was not associated with differences in overall survival. Acquired aneuploidy was frequently detected in recurrent gliomas and was characterized by IDH mutation but without co-deletion of chromosome arms 1p/19q, and further converged with acquired alterations in the cell cycle and poor outcomes. The clonal architecture of each tumour remained similar over time, but the presence of subclonal selection was associated with decreased survival. Finally, there were no differences in the levels of immunoediting between initial and recurrent gliomas. Collectively, our results suggest that the strongest selective pressures occur during early glioma development and that current therapies shape this evolution in a largely stochastic manner.",

Advances in genomics, metabolomics, and proteomics are improving our understanding regarding cancer metabolic diversity, resulting in detailed classifications of tumors and raising the effectiveness of precision medicine. Likewise, the growing knowledge of interactions between nutrients and the expression of certain genes could lead to cancer therapies based on precision nutrition strategies. This review aims to identify the recent advances in the knowledge of the mechanistic role of bioactive phytochemicals in foodstuffs in tumor progression, metastasis, and chemo-resistance in order to assess their potential use in precision nutrition therapies targeting relapse in lung, breast, colon, and prostate cancer, and leukemia. A considerable number of bioactive phytochemicals in foodstuffs were identified in the literature with proven effects modulating tumor growth, progression, and metastasis. In addition, the use of foodstuffs in cancer, and specifically in relapse therapies, is being reinforced by the development of different formulations that significantly increase the therapeutic efficiency of these products. This can open the possibility for testing combinations of bioactive phytochemicals with cancer relapse treatments as a potential prevention strategy.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a lethal malignancy with limited treatment options. Although metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of many cancers, including PDA, previous attempts to target metabolic changes therapeutically have been stymied by drug toxicity and tumour cell plasticity. Here, we show that PDA cells engage an eIF4F-dependent translation program that supports redox and central carbon metabolism. Inhibition of the eIF4F subunit, eIF4A, using the synthetic rocaglate CR-1-31-B (CR-31) reduced the viability of PDA organoids relative to their normal counterparts. In vivo, CR-31 suppresses tumour growth and extends survival of genetically-engineered murine models of PDA. Surprisingly, inhibition of eIF4A also induces glutamine reductive carboxylation. As a consequence, combined targeting of eIF4A and glutaminase activity more effectively inhibits PDA cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our work demonstrates the importance of eIF4A in translational control of pancreatic tumour metabolism and as a therapeutic target against PDA.",

CLL is an incurable disease with a heterogeneous clinical course, for which the treatment decision still relies on conventional parameters (such as clinical stage and lymphocyte doubling time). During the past 5 years, relevant advances have been made in understanding CLL biology. Indeed, substantial progress has been made in the identification of the putative cell of origin of CLL, and comprehensive studies have dissected the genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic landscape of CLL. Advances in clinical management include improvements in our understanding of the prognostic value of different genetic lesions, particularly those associated with chemoresistance and progression to highly aggressive forms of CLL, and the advent of new therapies targeting crucial biological pathways. In this Review, we discuss new insights into the genetic lesions involved in the pathogenesis of CLL and how these genetic insights influence clinical management and the development of new therapeutic strategies for this disease.",

    "abstract": "Akt signaling is an important regulator of neural development, but the distinctive function of Akt isoforms in brain development presents a challenge. Here we show Siah1 as an ubiquitin ligase that preferentially interacts with Akt3 and facilitates ubiquitination and degradation of Akt3. Akt3 is enriched in the axonal shaft and branches but not growth cone tips, where Siah1 is prominently present. Depletion of Siah1 enhanced Akt3 levels in the soma and axonal tips, eliciting multiple branching. Brain-specific somatic mutation in Akt3-E17K escapes from Siah1-mediated degradation and causes improper neural development with dysmorphic neurons. Remarkably, coexpression of Siah1 with Akt3-WT restricted disorganization of neural development is caused by Akt3 overexpression, whereas forced expression of Siah1 with the Akt3-E17K mutant fails to cope with malformation of neural development. These findings demonstrate that Siah1 limits Akt3 turnover during brain development and that this event is essential for normal organization of the neural network.",

Id proteins are primarily expressed during development to inhibit differentiation, but they become re-expressed in adult tissues in diseases of the vasculature and cancer. We show that the genetic loss of Id1/Id3 reduces ocular neovascularization in mouse models of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). An in silico screen identifies AGX51, a small-molecule Id antagonist. AGX51 inhibits the Id1-E47 interaction, leading to ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Ids, cell growth arrest, and reduced viability. AGX51 is well-tolerated in mice and phenocopies the genetic loss of Id expression in AMD and ROP models by inhibiting retinal neovascularization. Thus, AGX51 is a first-in-class compound that antagonizes an interaction formerly considered undruggable and that may have utility in the management of multiple diseases.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy shows a promise for treating glioblastoma (GBM), the most malignant and immunosuppressive glioma. The mesenchymal phenotype of cancer cells was frequently reported to be associated with their induction of immunosuppression within the cancer microenvironment. Overexpressed insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) promotes GBM cell migration and invasion, and contributes to glioma progression and cancer recurrence and poor survival in GBM. However, whether IGFBP2 can induce immunosuppression in GBM was not reported yet. Thus, the study applied a syngeneic mouse GBM model, human GBM samples, and cancer-immune cell co-culture experiments to investigate the effect of IGFBP2 on GBM exposed immune cells and its association with the mesenchymal induction. We found that IGFBP2 promoted the mesenchymal feature of GBM cells. The inhibition of IGFBP2 relieved immunosuppression by increasing CD8+ T and CD19+ B cells and decreasing CD163+ M2 macrophages. Further, the IGFBP2-promoted immunosuppression was associated with its induction of the mesenchymal feature of GBM cells and the inhibitory phosphorylated Fc\u03b3RIIB of GBM exposed immune cells. Blocking IGFBP2 suppressed tumor growth and improved survival of tumor bearing mice in the mouse GBM model. These findings support the notion that targeting the IGFBP2 may present an effective immunotherapeutic strategy for mesenchymal GBMs.",

    "abstract": "Inactivating mutations of the CREBBP and EP300 acetyltransferases are among the most common genetic alterations in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). Here, we examined the relationship between these two enzymes in germinal center (GC) B cells, the normal counterpart of FL and DLBCL, and in lymphomagenesis by using conditional GC-directed deletion mouse models targeting Crebbp or Ep300. We found that CREBBP and EP300 modulate common as well as distinct transcriptional programs implicated in separate anatomic and functional GC compartments. Consistently, deletion of Ep300 but not Crebbp impaired the fitness of GC B cells in\u00a0vivo. Combined loss of Crebbp and Ep300 completely abrogated GC formation, suggesting that these proteins partially compensate for each other through common transcriptional targets. This synthetic lethal interaction was retained in CREBBP-mutant DLBCL cells and could be pharmacologically targeted with selective small molecule inhibitors of CREBBP and EP300 function. These data provide proof-of-principle for the clinical development of EP300-specific inhibitors in FL and DLBCL.",

Dasatinib, a multikinase inhibitor, was effective against 50% of DLBCL cell lines, as well as against in vivo xenografts. Dasatinib was more broadly active than the Bruton kinase inhibitor ibrutinib and overcame ibrutinib resistance. Tumors exhibiting dasatinib resistance were commonly characterized by activation of the PI3K pathway and loss of PTEN expression as a specific biomarker. PI3K suppression by mTORC2 inhibition synergized with dasatinib and abolished resistance in vitro and in vivo. These results provide a proof of concept for the repurposing approach in DLBCL, and point to dasatinib as an attractive strategy for further clinical development in lymphomas.",

    "title": "Assembling nuclear domains: Lessons from DNA repair",
    "abstract": "Eukaryotic nuclei are organized into nuclear domains that unite loci sharing a common function. These domains are essential for diverse processes including (1) the formation of topologically associated domains (TADs) that coordinate replication and transcription, (2) the formation of specialized transcription and splicing factories, and (3) the clustering of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which concentrates damaged DNA for repair. The generation of nuclear domains requires forces that are beginning to be identified. In the case of DNA DSBs, DNA movement and clustering are driven by actin filament nucleators. Furthermore, RNAs and low-complexity protein domains such as RNA-binding proteins also accumulate around sites of transcription and repair. The link between liquid-liquid phase separation and actin nucleation in the formation of nuclear domains is still unknown. This review discusses DSB repair domain formation as a model for functional nuclear domains in other genomic contexts.",

    "abstract": "Despite considerable advances in the treatment of lymphoma, the prognosis of patients with relapsed and/or refractory disease continues to be poor; thus, a continued need exists for the development of novel approaches and therapies. Epigenetic dysregulation might drive and/or promote tumorigenesis in various types of malignancies and is prevalent in both B cell and T cell lymphomas. Over the past decade, a large number of epigenetic-modifying agents have been developed and introduced into the clinical management of patients with haematological malignancies. In this Review, we provide a concise overview of the most promising epigenetic therapies for the treatment of lymphomas, including inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACs), DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), bromodomain and extra-terminal domain proteins (BETs), protein arginine N-methyltransferases (PRMTs) and isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs), and highlight the most promising future directions of research in this area.",

    "title": "p53 modifications: exquisite decorations of the powerful guardian",
    "abstract": "The last 40\u00a0years have witnessed how p53 rose from a viral binding protein to a central factor in both stress responses and tumor suppression. The exquisite regulation of p53 functions is of vital importance for cell fate decisions. Among the multiple layers of mechanisms controlling p53 function, posttranslational modifications (PTMs) represent an efficient and precise way. Major p53 PTMs include phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, and methylation. Meanwhile, other PTMs like sumoylation, neddylation, O-GlcNAcylation, adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation, hydroxylation, and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrylation are also shown to play various roles in p53 regulation. By independent action or interaction, PTMs affect p53 stability, conformation, localization, and binding partners. Deregulation of the PTM-related pathway is among the major causes of p53-associated developmental disorders or diseases, especially in cancers. This review focuses on the roles of different p53 modification types and shows how these modifications are orchestrated to produce various outcomes by modulating p53 activities or targeted to treat different diseases caused by p53 dysregulation.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophils are a component of the tumor microenvironment and have been predominantly associated with cancer progression. Using a genetic approach complemented by adoptive transfer, we found that neutrophils are essential for resistance against primary 3-methylcholantrene-induced carcinogenesis. Neutrophils were essential for the activation of an interferon-\u03b3-dependent pathway of immune resistance, associated with polarization of a subset of CD4                 -                CD8                 -                unconventional \u03b1\u03b2 T\u00a0cells (UTC                 \u03b1\u03b2                ).

In selected human tumors, including undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, CSF3R expression, a neutrophil signature and neutrophil infiltration were associated with a type 1 immune response and better clinical outcome. Thus, neutrophils driving UTC                 \u03b1\u03b2                polarization and type 1 immunity are essential for resistance against murine sarcomas and selected human tumors.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence defines an irreversible cell growth arrest state linked to loss of tissue function and aging in mammals. This transition from proliferation to senescence is typically characterized by increased expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor p16                 INK4a                and formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF). SAHF formation depends on HIRA-mediated nucleosome assembly of histone H3.3, which is regulated by the serine/threonine protein kinase Pak2. However, it is unknown if Pak2 contributes to cellular senescence. Here, we show that depletion of Pak2 delayed oncogene-induced senescence in IMR90 human fibroblasts and oxidative stress-induced senescence of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), whereas overexpression of Pak2 accelerated senescence of IMR90 cells. Importantly, depletion of Pak2 in BubR1 progeroid mice attenuated the onset of aging-associated phenotypes and extended life span. Pak2 is required for expression of genes involved in cellular senescence and regulated the deposition of newly synthesized H3.3 onto chromatin in senescent cells. Together, our results demonstrate that Pak2 is an important regulator of cellular senescence and organismal aging, in part through the regulation of gene expression and H3.3 nucleosome assembly.",

    "abstract": "B cell development requires efficient proliferation and successful assembly and modifications of the immunoglobulin gene products. CtIP is an essential gene implicated in end resection and DNA repair. Here, we show that CtIP is essential for early B cell development but dispensable in naive B cells. CtIP loss is well tolerated in G1-arrested B cells and during V(D)J recombination, but in proliferating B cells, CtIP loss leads to a progressive cell death characterized by ATM hyperactivation, G2/M arrest, genomic instability, and 53BP1 nuclear body formation, indicating that the essential role of CtIP during proliferation underscores its stage-specific requirement in B cells. B cell proliferation requires phosphorylation of CtIP at T847 presumably by CDK, but not its interaction with CtBP or Rb or its nuclease activity. CtIP phosphorylation by ATM/ATR at T859 (T855 in mice) promotes end resection in G1-arrested cells but is dispensable for B cell development and class switch recombination, suggesting distinct roles for T859 and T847 phosphorylation in B cell development.",

    "abstract": "The classical nonhomologous end-joining (cNHEJ) pathway is a major DNA double-strand break repair pathway in mammalian cells and is required for lymphocyte development and maturation. The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is a cNHEJ factor that encompasses the Ku70-Ku80 (KU) heterodimer and the large DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). In mouse models, loss of DNA-PKcs (                 DNA-PKcs                   -/-                 ) abrogates end processing (e.g., hairpin opening), but not end-ligation, whereas expression of the kinase-dead DNA-PKcs protein (                 DNA-PKcs                   KD/KD                 ) abrogates end-ligation, suggesting a kinase-dependent structural function of DNA-PKcs during cNHEJ. Lymphocyte development is abolished in                 DNA-PKcs                   -/-                 and                 DNA-PKcs                   KD/KD                 mice because of the requirement for both hairpin opening and end-ligation during V(D)J recombination. DNA-PKcs itself is the best-characterized substrate of DNA-PK. The S2056 cluster is the best-characterized autophosphorylation site in human DNA-PKcs. In this study, we show that radiation can induce phosphorylation of murine DNA-PKcs at the corresponding S2053. We also generated knockin mouse models with alanine- (DNA-PKcs                 PQR                ) or phospho-mimetic aspartate (DNA-PKcs                 SD                ) substitutions at the S2053 cluster. Despite moderate radiation sensitivity in the                 DNA-PKcs                   PQR/PQR                 fibroblasts and lymphocytes, both                 DNA-PKcs                   PQR/PQR                 and                 DNA-PKcs                   SD/SD                 mice retained normal kinase activity and underwent efficient V(D)J recombination and class switch recombination, indicating that phosphorylation at the S2053 cluster of murine DNA-PKcs (corresponding to S2056 of human DNA-PKcs), although important for radiation resistance, is dispensable for the end-ligation and hairpin-opening function of DNA-PK essential for lymphocyte development.",

    "abstract": "Alternative pre-mRNA-splicing-induced post-transcriptional gene expression regulation is one of the pathways for tumors maintaining proliferation rates accompanying the malignant phenotype under stress. Here, we uncover a list of hyperacetylated proteins in the context of acutely reduced Acetyl-CoA levels under nutrient starvation. PHF5A, a component of U2 snRNPs, can be acetylated at lysine 29 in response to multiple cellular stresses, which is dependent on p300. PHF5A acetylation strengthens the interaction among U2 snRNPs and affects global pre-mRNA splicing pattern and extensive gene expression. PHF5A hyperacetylation-induced alternative splicing stabilizes KDM3A mRNA and promotes its protein expression. Pathologically, PHF5A K29 hyperacetylation and KDM3A upregulation axis are correlated with poor prognosis of colon cancer. Our findings uncover a mechanism of an anti-stress pathway through which acetylation on PHF5A promotes the cancer cells' capacity for stress resistance and consequently contributes to colon carcinogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Hypermutagenesis refers to marked increase in the number of mutations due to continuous mutagenic process. Hypermutated tumors, have being found in several tumor types, are associated with inherited or acquired alterations in the DNA repair pathways. Hypermutation has been observed in a subset of adult glioma patients as a direct result of temozolomide(TMZ)-induced mutagenesis. In our study, we have identified a rare subset of treatment-na\u00efve adult gliomas with de novo hypermutator phenotype and explored the evolution of spontaneous and treatment-induced hypermutagenesis. We conducted Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES), Whole-Transcriptome Sequencing (WTS), and Single-Cell Sequencing (SCS) of TMZ-na\u00efve and post-TMZ-treated hypermutated tumors to identify distinct clinical or genomic manifestations that contribute to the development of hypermutation in untreated adult gliomas. TMZ-na\u00efve hypermutated tumors were marked by absence of IDH1 somatic mutation and MGMT promoter (pMGMT) methylation, two genomic traits that were significantly associated with the TMZ-induced hypermutagenic event in glioblastoma, and harbored inherited alterations in the mismatch repair (MMR) machinery. The immediate family members of the TMZ-naive hypermutated glioma patients were also previous diagnosed with cancer development history, suggesting that germline dysfunction of the MMR pathway could potentially pose hereditary risk to genetic predisposition of carcinogenesis in gliomas. Lastly, both TMZ-na\u00efve and post-TMZ-treated hypermutated tumors exhibited a significant accumulation of neoantigen loads, suggesting immunotherapeutic alternatives. Our results present new and unique understanding of hypermutagenic process in adult gliomas and an important step towards clinical implication of immunotherapy in glioma treatment.",

    "abstract": "The histological diagnosis of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) can represent a challenge, particularly in the case of closely related entities such as angioimmunoblastic T-lymphoma (AITL), PTCL-not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), and ALK-negative anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL). Although gene expression profiling and next generations sequencing have been proven to define specific features recurrently associated with distinct entities, genomic-based stratifications have not yet led to definitive diagnostic criteria and/or entered into the routine clinical practice. Herein, to improve the current molecular classification between AITL and PTCL-NOS, we analyzed the transcriptional profiles from 503 PTCLs stratified according to their molecular configuration and integrated them with genomic data of recurrently mutated genes (RHOA                 G17V                , TET2, IDH2                 R172                , and DNMT3A) in 53 cases (39 AITLs and 14 PTCL-NOSs) included in the series. Our analysis unraveled that the mutational status of RHOA                 G17V                , TET2, and DNMT3A poorly correlated, individually, with peculiar transcriptional fingerprints. Conversely, in IDH2                 R172                samples a strong transcriptional signature was identified that could act as a surrogate for mutational status. The integrated analysis of clinical, mutational, and molecular data led to a simplified 19-gene signature that retains high accuracy in differentiating the main nodal PTCL entities. The expression levels of those genes were confirmed in an independent cohort profiled by RNA-sequencing.",

    "abstract": "The DNA damage response protein ATM has long been known to influence class switch recombination in ex vivo-cultured B cells. However, an assessment of B cell-intrinsic requirement of ATM in humoral responses in vivo was confounded by the fact that its germline deletion affects T cell function, and B:T cell interactions are critical for in vivo immune responses. In this study, we demonstrate that B cell-specific deletion of ATM in mice leads to reduction in germinal center (GC) frequency and size in response to immunization. We find that loss of ATM induces apoptosis of GC B cells, likely due to unresolved DNA lesions in cells attempting to undergo class-switch recombination. Accordingly, suboptimal GC responses in ATM-deficient animals are characterized by decreased titers of class-switched Abs and decreased rates of somatic hypermutation. These results unmask the critical B cell-intrinsic role of ATM in maintaining an optimal GC response following immunization.",

Tumor suppressor genes regulate multiple signaling networks that restrict cellular proliferation and present barriers to malignant transformation. While bona fide tumor suppressors such as                 PTEN                and                 TP53                often undergo inactivation due to mutations, there are several genes for which genomic deletion is the primary route for tumor progression. To functionally identify putative tumor suppressors in GBM, we employed in vivo RNAi screening using patient-derived xenograft models. Here, we identified PIP4K2A, whose functional role and clinical relevance remain unexplored in GBM. We discovered that PIP4K2A negatively regulates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling via p85/p110 component degradation in                 PTEN                -deficient GBMs and specifically targets p85 for proteasome-mediated degradation. Overexpression of                 PIP4K2A                suppressed cellular and clonogenic growth in vitro and impeded tumor growth in vivo. Our results unravel a novel tumor-suppressive role of PIP4K2A for the first time and support the feasibility of combining oncogenomics with in vivo RNAi screen.",

    "title": "ALOX12 is required for p53-mediated tumour suppression through a distinct ferroptosis pathway",
    "abstract": "It is well established that ferroptosis is primarily controlled by glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Surprisingly, we observed that p53 activation modulates ferroptotic responses without apparent effects on GPX4 function. Instead, ALOX12 inactivation diminishes p53-mediated ferroptosis induced by reactive oxygen species stress and abrogates p53-dependent inhibition of tumour growth in xenograft models, suggesting that ALOX12 is critical for p53-mediated ferroptosis. The ALOX12 gene resides on human chromosome 17p13.1, a hotspot of monoallelic deletion in human cancers. Loss of one Alox12 allele is sufficient to accelerate tumorigenesis in E\u03bc-Myc lymphoma models. Moreover, ALOX12 missense mutations from human cancers abrogate its ability to oxygenate polyunsaturated fatty acids and to induce p53-mediated ferroptosis. Notably, ALOX12 is dispensable for ferroptosis induced by erastin or GPX4 inhibitors; conversely, ACSL4 is required for ferroptosis upon GPX4 inhibition but dispensable for p53-mediated ferroptosis. Thus, our study identifies an ALOX12-mediated, ACSL4-independent ferroptosis pathway that is critical for p53-dependent tumour suppression.",

CD8                 +                T cells activated by cancer immunotherapy clear tumours mainly by inducing cell death through perforin-granzyme and Fas-Fas ligand pathways                 3,4                . Ferroptosis is a form of cell death that differs from apoptosis and results from iron-dependent accumulation of lipid peroxide                 5,6                . Although it has been investigated in vitro                 7,8                , there is emerging evidence that ferroptosis might be implicated in a variety of pathological scenarios                 9,10                . It is unclear whether, and how, ferroptosis is involved in T cell immunity and cancer immunotherapy. Here we show that immunotherapy-activated CD8                 +                T cells enhance ferroptosis-specific lipid peroxidation in tumour cells, and that increased ferroptosis contributes to the anti-tumour efficacy of immunotherapy. Mechanistically, interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) released from CD8                 +                T cells downregulates the expression of SLC3A2 and SLC7A11, two subunits of the glutamate-cystine antiporter system x                 c                 -                , impairs the uptake of cystine by tumour cells, and as a consequence, promotes tumour cell lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. In mouse models, depletion of cystine or cysteine by cyst(e)inase (an engineered enzyme that degrades both cystine and cysteine) in combination with checkpoint blockade synergistically enhanced T cell-mediated anti-tumour immunity and induced ferroptosis in tumour cells. Expression of system x                 c                 -                was negatively associated, in cancer patients, with CD8                 +                T cell signature, IFN\u03b3 expression, and patient outcome. Analyses of human transcriptomes before and during nivolumab therapy revealed that clinical benefits correlate with reduced expression of SLC3A2 and increased IFN\u03b3 and CD8. Thus, T cell-promoted tumour ferroptosis is an anti-tumour mechanism, and targeting this pathway in combination with checkpoint blockade is a potential therapeutic approach.",

    "title": "The Deubiquitylase OTUB1 Mediates Ferroptosis via Stabilization of SLC7A11",
    "abstract": "Although cell-cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis are established mechanisms of tumor suppression, accumulating evidence reveals that ferroptosis, an iron-dependent, nonapoptotic form of cell death, represents a new regulatory pathway in suppressing tumor development. Ferroptosis is triggered by lipid peroxidation and is tightly regulated by SLC7A11, a key component of the cystine-glutamate antiporter. Although many studies demonstrate the importance of transcriptional regulation of SLC7A11 in ferroptotic responses, it remains largely unknown how the stability of SLC7A11 is controlled in human cancers. In this study, we utilized biochemial purification to identify the ubiquitin hydrolase OTUB1 as a key factor in modulating SLC7A11 stability. OTUB1 directly interacted with and stabilized SLC7A11; conversely, OTUB1 knockdown diminished SLC7A11 levels in cancer cells. OTUB1 was overexpressed in human cancers, and inactivation of OTUB1 destabilized SLC7A11 and led to growth suppression of tumor xenografts in mice, which was associated with reduced activation of ferroptosis. Notably, overexpression of the cancer stem cell marker CD44 enhanced the stability of SLC7A11 by promoting the interaction between SLC7A11 and OTUB1; depletion of CD44 partially abrogated this interaction. CD44 expression suppressed ferroptosis in cancer cells in an OTUB1-dependent manner. Together, these results show that OTUB1 plays an essential role in controlling the stability of SLC7A11 and the CD44-mediated effects on ferroptosis in human cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: This study identifies OTUB1 as a key regulator of ferroptosis and implicates it as a potential target in cancer therapy.

    "abstract": "MDM2 (Murine double minute 2) acts as a key repressor for p53-mediated tumor-suppressor functions, which includes cellular senescence. We found that MDM2 can promote cellular senescence by modulating WRN stability. Werner syndrome (WS), caused by mutations of the WRN gene, is an autosomal recessive disease, which is characterized by premature aging. Loss of WRN function induces cellular senescence in human cancer cells. Here, we found that MDM2 acts as an E3 ligase for WRN protein. MDM2 interacts with WRN both in vivo and in vitro. MDM2 induces ubiquitination of WRN and dramatically downregulates the levels of WRN protein in human cells. During DNA damage response, WRN is translocated to the nucleoplasm to facilitate its DNA repair functions; however, it is degraded by the MDM2-mediated ubiquitination pathway. Moreover, the senescent phenotype induced by DNA damage reagents, such as Etoposide, is at least in part mediated by MDM2-dependent WRN degradation as it can be significantly attenuated by ectopic expression of WRN. These results show that MDM2 is critically involved in regulating WRN function via ubiquitin-dependent degradation and reveal an unexpected role of MDM2 in promoting cellular senescence through a p53-independent manner.",

    "abstract": "p53 is an essential tumor suppressor, whose activity is finely tuned by the posttranslational modifications. Previous research has reported that \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) induces \u03b2-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb), which is a novel histone posttranslational modification. Here we report that p53 is modified by kbhb and that this modification occurs at lysines 120, 319, and 370 of p53. We demonstrate that the level of p53 kbhb is dramatically increased in cultured cells treated with BHB and in thymus tissues of fasted mice, and that CBP catalyze p53 kbhb. We show that p53 kbhb results in lower levels of p53 acetylation and reduced expression of the p53 downstream genes p21 and PUMA, as well as reduced cell growth arrest and apoptosis in cultured cells under p53-activating conditions. Similar results were observed in mouse thymus tissue under starvation conditions, which result in increased concentrations of serum BHB, and in response to genotoxic stress caused by \u03b3-irradiation to activate p53. Our findings thus show that BHB-mediated p53 kbhb is a novel mechanism of p53 activity regulation, which may explain the link between ketone bodies and tumor, and which may provide promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Our previous study showed that the oncoprotein SET acts as a new reader of unacetylated p53 for transcriptional repression. To further elucidate the physiological significance of SET in vivo, we generated set knockout mice. Set knockout mice died during embryonic development between day 11.5 and day 12.5 post coitum, exhibiting cardiac edema and open neural tube, among other developmental defects. Further analyses revealed that loss of SET leads to upregulation of p53 target genes including p21 and puma without any obvious effect on p53 stability in set knockout embryos. Notably, the developmental defects of set knockout mice were significantly, but nonetheless partially, rescued by concomitant deletion of p53. The failure to obtain fully live set/p53 double knockout mice suggested that p53-independent targets of SET also contribute to the embryonic lethality of set knockout mice. Indeed, we found that FOXO1 acts as an important target of SET and that SET-mediated regulation of FOXO1 is also acetylation-dependent. Taken together, these data underscore the importance of SET oncoprotein during embryonic development and reveal both of the p53-dependent and the p53-independent functions of SET in vivo.",

    "title": "Phf6              Loss Enhances HSC Self-Renewal Driving Tumor Initiation and Leukemia Stem Cell Activity in T-ALL",
    "abstract": "The plant homeodomain 6 gene (                 PHF6                ) is frequently mutated in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL); however, its specific functional role in leukemia development remains to be established. Here, we show that loss of                 PHF6                is an early mutational event in leukemia transformation. Mechanistically, genetic inactivation of                 Phf6                in the hematopoietic system enhances hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) long-term self-renewal and hematopoietic recovery after chemotherapy by rendering                 Phf6                knockout HSCs more quiescent and less prone to stress-induced activation. Consistent with a leukemia-initiating tumor suppressor role, inactivation of                 Phf6                in hematopoietic progenitors lowers the threshold for the development of NOTCH1-induced T-ALL. Moreover, loss of                 Phf6                in leukemia lymphoblasts activates a leukemia stem cell transcriptional program and drives enhanced T-ALL leukemia-initiating cell activity. These results implicate                 Phf6                in the control of HSC homeostasis and long-term self-renewal and support a role for                 PHF6                loss as a driver of leukemia-initiating cell activity in T-ALL. SIGNIFICANCE:                 Phf6                controls HSC homeostasis, leukemia initiation, and T-ALL leukemia-initiating cell self-renewal. These results substantiate a role for                 PHF6                mutations as early events and drivers of leukemia stem cell activity in the pathogenesis of T-ALL.

    "abstract": "B cell lymphomas comprise a heterogeneous group of genetically, biologically, and clinically distinct neoplasms that, in most cases, originate from the clonal expansion of B cells in the germinal center (GC). In recent years, the advent of novel genomics technologies has revolutionized our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancies as a multistep process that requires the progressive accumulation of multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations. A common theme that emerged from these studies is the ability of lymphoma cells to co-opt the same biological programs and signal transduction networks that operate during the normal GC reaction, and misuse them for their own survival advantage. This review summarizes recent progress in the understanding of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that drive the malignant transformation of GC B cells. These insights provide a conceptual framework for the identification of cellular pathways that may be explored for precision medicine approaches.",

    "abstract": "Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. A key pathogenic factor in the development of lethal heart failure is loss of terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes. However, mechanisms of cardiomyocyte death remain unclear. Here, we discovered and demonstrated that ferroptosis, a programmed iron-dependent cell death, as a mechanism in murine models of doxorubicin (DOX)- and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced cardiomyopathy. In canonical apoptosis and/or necroptosis-defective                 Ripk3                 -/-                ,                 Mlkl                 -/-                , or                 Fadd                 -/-                 Mlkl                 -/-                mice, DOX-treated cardiomyocytes showed features of typical ferroptotic cell death. Consistently, compared with dexrazoxane, the only FDA-approved drug for treating DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, inhibition of ferroptosis by ferrostatin-1 significantly reduced DOX cardiomyopathy. RNA-sequencing results revealed that heme oxygenase-1 (                 Hmox1                ) was significantly up-regulated in DOX-treated murine hearts. Administering DOX to mice induced cardiomyopathy with a rapid, systemic accumulation of nonheme iron via heme degradation by Nrf2-mediated up-regulation of Hmox1, which effect was abolished in                 Nrf2                -deficent mice. Conversely, zinc protoporphyrin IX, an Hmox1 antagonist, protected the DOX-treated mice, suggesting free iron released on heme degradation is necessary and sufficient to induce cardiac injury. Given that ferroptosis is driven by damage to lipid membranes, we further investigated and found that excess free iron accumulated in mitochondria and caused lipid peroxidation on its membrane. Mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoTEMPO significantly rescued DOX cardiomyopathy, supporting oxidative damage of mitochondria as a major mechanism in ferroptosis-induced heart damage. Importantly, ferrostatin-1 and iron chelation also ameliorated heart failure induced by both acute and chronic I/R in mice. These findings highlight that targeting ferroptosis serves as a cardioprotective strategy for cardiomyopathy prevention.",

    "abstract": "A major hallmark of cancer is a perturbed metabolism resulting in high demand for various metabolites, glucose being the most well studied. While glucose can be converted into pyruvate for ATP production, the serine synthesis pathway (SSP) can divert glucose to generate serine, glycine, and methionine. In the process, the carbon unit from serine is incorporated into the one-carbon pool which makes methionine and maintains S-adenosylmethionine levels, which are needed to maintain the epigenetic landscape and ultimately controlling what genes are available for transcription. Alternatively, the carbon unit can be used for purine and thymidylate synthesis. We present here an approach to follow the flux through this pathway in cultured human cells using stable isotope enriched glucose and gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis of serine, glycine, and methionine. We demonstrate that in three different cell lines this pathway contributes only 1-2% of total intracellular methionine. This suggests under high extracellular methionine conditions, the predominance of carbon units from this pathway are used to synthesize nucleic acids.",

    "abstract": "Neural stem cells (NSCs) give rise to the central nervous system (CNS) and persist in certain areas of adult brains for replenishing damaged differentiated cells. The loss of the balance between NSC self-renewal and differentiation could lead to tumor formation such as the occurrence of glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly human brain tumor, which could be derived from neural stem or stem-like cells. Early studies showed that insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) mRNA levels were maintained high during the fetal brain development but decreased in the adult brains. We previously reported that IGFBP2 was frequently overexpressed in GBMs, which was correlated with GBM recurrence and poor survival and promoted glioma progression. However, the role of IGFBP2 in the CNS was not investigated yet, whose understanding will help elucidate IGFBP2 functions in GBM. In the study, we identify IGFBP2 as a critical molecule for mouse NSC maintenance. IGFBP2 is highly expressed in NSCs, and its expression exhibits an apical-basal pattern in the neural tube with a higher apical level and decreased with NSC differentiation during the CNS development. IGFBP2 promotes NSC self-renewal and proliferation but inhibits its differentiation to neurons and astrocytes. The knockdown of IGFBP2 significantly affected the expression of cell cycle, Notch pathway, and neural stemness and differentiation genes in NSCs. Further, the expression of IGFBP2-regulated cell cycle genes is significantly correlated with IGFBP2 expression in non-Mesenchymal GBM subtypes including Classical, Proneural, and Neural subtypes and of its Notch pathway genes differentially associated in the four GBM subtypes, altogether suggesting its critical and similar functions in NSCs and GBM cells.",

    "abstract": "To understand drug combination effect, it is necessary to decipher the interactions between drug targets-many of which are signaling molecules. Previously, such signaling pathway models are largely based on the compilation of literature data from heterogeneous cellular contexts. Indeed, de novo reconstruction of signaling interactions from large-scale molecular profiling is still lagging, compared to similar efforts in transcriptional and protein-protein interaction networks. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel algorithm for the systematic inference of protein kinase pathways, and applied it to published mass spectrometry-based phosphotyrosine profile data from 250 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) samples. The resulting network includes 43 TKs and 415 inferred, LUAD-specific substrates, which were validated at >60% accuracy by SILAC assays, including \"novel' substrates of the EGFR and c-MET TKs, which play a critical oncogenic role in lung cancer. This systematic, data-driven model supported drug response prediction on an individual sample basis, including accurate prediction and validation of synergistic EGFR and c-MET inhibitor activity in cells lacking mutations in either gene, thus contributing to current precision oncology efforts.",

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common tumor predisposition syndrome in which glioma is one of the prevalent tumors. Gliomagenesis in NF1 results in a heterogeneous spectrum of low- to high-grade neoplasms occurring during the entire lifespan of patients. The pattern of genetic and epigenetic alterations of glioma that develops in NF1 patients and the similarities with sporadic glioma remain unknown. Here, we present the molecular landscape of low- and high-grade gliomas in patients affected by NF1 (NF1-glioma). We found that the predisposing germline mutation of the NF1 gene was frequently converted to homozygosity and the somatic mutational load of NF1-glioma was influenced by age and grade. High-grade tumors harbored genetic alterations of TP53 and CDKN2A, frequent mutations of ATRX associated with Alternative Lengthening of Telomere, and were enriched in genetic alterations of transcription/chromatin regulation and PI3 kinase pathways. Low-grade tumors exhibited fewer mutations that were over-represented in genes of the MAP kinase pathway. Approximately 50% of low-grade NF1-gliomas displayed an immune signature, T lymphocyte infiltrates, and increased neo-antigen load. DNA methylation assigned NF1-glioma to LGm6, a poorly defined Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 wild-type subgroup enriched with ATRX mutations. Thus, the profiling of NF1-glioma defined a distinct landscape that recapitulates a subset of sporadic tumors.",

    "abstract": "ATR kinase is activated by RPA-coated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to orchestrate DNA damage responses. Here we show that ATR inhibition differs from ATR loss. Mouse model expressing kinase-dead ATR (Atr                 +/KD                ), but not loss of ATR (Atr                 +/-                ), displays ssDNA-dependent defects at the non-homologous region of X-Y chromosomes during male meiosis leading to sterility, and at telomeres, rDNA, and fragile sites during mitosis leading to lymphocytopenia. Mechanistically, we find that ATR kinase activity is necessary for the rapid exchange of ATR at DNA-damage-sites, which in turn promotes CHK1-phosphorylation. ATR-KD, but not loss of ATR, traps a subset of ATR and RPA on chromatin, where RPA is hyper-phosphorylated by ATM/DNA-PKcs and prevents downstream repair. Consequently, Atr                 +/KD                cells have shorter inter-origin distances and are vulnerable to induced fork collapses, genome instability and mitotic catastrophe. These results reveal mechanistic differences between ATR inhibition and ATR loss, with implications for ATR signaling and cancer therapy.",

    "title": "Inactive Atm abrogates DSB repair in mouse cerebellum more than does Atm loss, without causing a neurological phenotype",
    "abstract": "The genome instability syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is caused by null mutations in the ATM gene, that lead to complete loss or inactivation of the gene's product, the ATM protein kinase. ATM is the primary mobilizer of the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) - a broad signaling network in which many components are ATM targets. The major clinical feature of A-T is cerebellar atrophy, characterized by relentless loss of Purkinje and granule cells. In Atm-knockout (Atm-KO) mice, complete loss of Atm leads to a very mild neurological phenotype, suggesting that Atm loss is not sufficient to markedly abrogate cerebellar structure and function in this organism. Expression of inactive (\"kinase-dead\") Atm (Atm                 KD                ) in mice leads to embryonic lethality, raising the question of whether conditional expression of Atm                 KD                in the murine nervous system would lead to a more pronounced neurological phenotype than Atm loss. We generated two mouse strains in which Atm                 KD                was conditionally expressed as the sole Atm species: one in the CNS and one specifically in Purkinje cells. Focusing our analysis on Purkinje cells, the dynamics of DSB readouts indicated that DSB repair was delayed longer in the presence of Atm                 KD                compared to Atm loss. However, both strains exhibited normal life span and displayed no gross cerebellar histological abnormalities or significant neurological phenotype. We conclude that the presence of Atm                 KD                is indeed more harmful to DSB repair than Atm loss, but the murine central nervous system can reasonably tolerate the extent of this DSB repair impairment. Greater pressure needs to be exerted on genome stability to obtain a mouse model that recapitulates the severe A-T neurological phenotype.",

The discovery of frequent germline mutations in the histone methyltransferase KMT2D and the demethylase KDM6A revealed a causative role for histone modifiers in this disease. However, the role of missense mutations has remained unexplored. Here, we expanded the mutation spectrum of KMT2D and KDM6A in KS by identifying 37 new KMT2D sequence variants. Moreover, we functionally dissected 14 KMT2D missense variants, by investigating their impact on the protein enzymatic activity and the binding to members of the WRAD complex. We demonstrate impaired H3K4 methyltransferase activity in 9 of the 14 mutant alleles and show that this reduced activity is due in part to disruption of protein complex formation. These findings have relevant implications for diagnostic and counseling purposes in this disease.",

    "abstract": "The BRCA1 tumor suppressor preserves genome integrity through both homology-directed repair (HDR) and stalled fork protection (SFP). In\u00a0vivo, BRCA1 exists as a heterodimer with the BARD1 tumor suppressor, and both proteins harbor a phosphate-binding BRCT domain. Here, we compare mice with mutations that ablate BRCT phospho-recognition by Bard1 (Bard1                 S563F                and Bard1                 K607A                ) or Brca1 (Brca1                 S1598F                ). Brca1                 S1598F                abrogates both HDR and SFP, suggesting that both pathways are likely impaired in most BRCA1 mutant tumors. Although not affecting HDR, the Bard1 mutations ablate poly(ADP-ribose)-dependent recruitment of BRCA1/BARD1 to stalled replication forks, resulting in fork degradation and chromosome instability. Nonetheless, Bard1                 S563F/S563F                and Bard1                 K607A/K607A                mice, unlike Brca1                 S1598F/S1598F                mice, are not tumor prone, indicating that HDR alone is sufficient to suppress tumor formation in the absence of SFP. Nevertheless, because SFP, unlike HDR, is also impaired in heterozygous Brca1/Bard1 mutant cells, SFP and HDR may contribute to distinct stages of tumorigenesis in BRCA1/BARD1 mutation carriers.",

    "abstract": "Although essential for epigenetic inheritance, the transfer of parental histone (H3-H4)                 2                tetramers that contain epigenetic modifications to replicating DNA strands is poorly understood. Here, we show that the Mcm2-Ctf4-Pol\u03b1 axis facilitates the transfer of parental (H3-H4)                 2                tetramers to lagging-strand DNA at replication forks. Mutating the conserved histone-binding domain of the Mcm2 subunit of the CMG (Cdc45-MCM-GINS) DNA helicase, which translocates along the leading-strand template, results in a marked enrichment of parental (H3-H4)                 2                on leading strand, due to the impairment of the transfer of parental (H3-H4)                 2                to lagging strands. Similar effects are observed in Ctf4 and Pol\u03b1 primase mutants that disrupt the connection of the CMG helicase to Pol\u03b1 that resides on lagging-strand template. Our results support a model whereby parental (H3-H4)                 2                complexes displaced from nucleosomes by DNA unwinding at replication forks are transferred by the CMG-Ctf4-Pol\u03b1 complex to lagging-strand DNA for nucleosome assembly at the original location.",

The fundamental tenet of precision oncology defines molecular characterization of tumors to guide optimal patient-tailored therapy. Towards this goal, we have established a compilation of pharmacological landscapes of 462 patient-derived tumor cells (PDCs) across 14 cancer types, together with genomic and transcriptomic profiling in 385 of these tumors. Compared with the traditional long-term cultured cancer cell line models, PDCs recapitulate the molecular properties and biology of the diseases more precisely. Here, we provide insights into dynamic pharmacogenomic associations, including molecular determinants that elicit therapeutic resistance to EGFR inhibitors, and the potential repurposing of ibrutinib (currently used in hematological malignancies) for EGFR-specific therapy in gliomas. Lastly, we present a potential implementation of PDC-derived drug sensitivities for the prediction of clinical response to targeted therapeutics using retrospective clinical studies.",

Here we show that parental (H3-H4)                 2                tetramers are assembled into nucleosomes onto both leading and lagging strands, with a slight preference for lagging strands. The lagging-strand preference increases markedly in budding yeast cells lacking Dpb3 and Dpb4, two subunits of the leading strand DNA polymerase, Pol \u03b5, owing to the impairment of parental (H3-H4)                 2                transfer to leading strands. Dpb3-Dpb4 binds H3-H4 in vitro and participates in the inheritance of heterochromatin. These results indicate that different proteins facilitate the transfer of parental (H3-H4)                 2                onto leading versus lagging strands and that Dbp3-Dpb4 plays an important role in this poorly understood process.",

Here, we report that p53 physically interacts with histone deacetylase SIRT6 in vitro and in vivo, and this interaction increases following palmitic acid (PA) treatment. In response to PA, p53 and SIRT6 localize to chromatin in a p53-dependent manner. Chromatin p53 and SIRT6 bind the promoters of CDP-diacylglycerol synthase 1 and 2 (CDS1 and CDS2), two enzymes required to catalyze CL de novo biosynthesis. Here, SIRT6 serves as a co-activator of p53 and effectively recruits RNA polymerase II to the CDS1 and CDS2 promoters to enhance CL de novo biosynthesis. Our findings reveal a novel, cooperative model executed by p53 and SIRT6 to maintain lipid homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "The gene encoding the MEF2B transcription factor is mutated in germinal center (GC)-derived B cell lymphomas, but its role in GC development and lymphomagenesis is unknown. We demonstrate that Mef2b deletion reduces GC formation in mice and identify MEF2B transcriptional targets in GC, with roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis, GC confinement, and differentiation. The most common lymphoma-associated MEF2B mutant (MEF2B                 D83V                ) is\u00a0hypomorphic, yet escapes binding and negative regulation by components of the HUCA complex and class\u00a0IIa HDACs. Mef2b                 D83V                expression in mice leads to GC enlargement and lymphoma development, a phenotype that becomes fully penetrant in combination with BCL2 de-regulation, an event associated with human MEF2B mutations. These results identify MEF2B as a critical GC regulator and a driver oncogene in lymphomagenesis.",

    "title": "Mesenchymal glioblastoma constitutes a major ceRNA signature in the TGF-\u03b2 pathway",
    "abstract": "Rationale:                Competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks play important roles in posttranscriptional regulation. Their dysregulation is common in cancer. However, ceRNA signatures have been poorly examined in the invasive and aggressive phenotypes of mesenchymal glioblastoma (GBM). This study aims to characterize mesenchymal glioblastoma at the mRNA-miRNA level and identify the mRNAs in ceRNA networks (micNET) markers and their mechanisms in tumorigenesis.                 Methods:                The mRNAs in ceRNA networks (micNETs) of glioblastoma were investigated by constructing a GBM ceRNA network followed by integration with a STRING protein interaction network. The prognostic micNET markers of mesenchymal GBM were identified and validated across multiple datasets. ceRNA interactions were identified between micNETs and miR181 family members. LY2109761, an inhibitor of TGFBR2, demonstrated tumor-suppressive effects on both primary cultured cells and a patient-derived xenograft intracranial model.                 Results:                We characterized mesenchymal glioblastoma at the mRNA-miRNA level and reported a ceRNA network that could separate the mesenchymal subtype from other subtypes. Six genes (TGFBR2, RUNX1, PPARG, ACSL1, GIT2 and RAP1B) that interacted with each other in both a ceRNA-related manner and in terms of their protein functions were identified as markers of the mesenchymal subtype. The coding sequence (CDS) and 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of TGFBR2 upregulated the expression of these genes, whereas TGFBR2 inhibition by siRNA or miR-181a/d suppressed their expression levels. Furthermore, mesenchymal subtype-related genes and the invasion phenotype could be reversed by suppressing the six mesenchymal marker genes.                 Conclusions:                This study suggests that the micNETs may have translational significance in the diagnosis of mesenchymal GBM and may be novel therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Generation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is required for the template strand formation during DNA replication. Replication Protein A (RPA) is an ssDNA-binding protein essential for protecting ssDNA at replication forks in eukaryotic cells. While significant progress has been made in characterizing the role of the RPA-ssDNA complex, how RPA is loaded at replication forks remains poorly explored. Here, we show that the                 Saccharomyces cerevisiae                protein regulator of Ty1 transposition 105 (Rtt105) binds RPA and helps load it at replication forks. Cells lacking Rtt105 exhibit a dramatic reduction in RPA loading at replication forks, compromised DNA synthesis under replication stress, and increased genome instability. Mechanistically, we show that Rtt105 mediates the RPA-importin interaction and also promotes RPA binding to ssDNA directly                 in\u00a0vitro                , but is not present in the final RPA-ssDNA complex. Single-molecule studies reveal that Rtt105 affects the binding mode of RPA to ssDNA These results support a model in which Rtt105 functions as an RPA chaperone that escorts RPA to the nucleus and facilitates its loading onto ssDNA at replication forks.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell genetics were used to interrogate clonal complexity and the sequence of mutational events in STIL-TAL1+ T-ALL. Single-cell multicolour FISH was used to demonstrate that the earliest detectable leukaemia subclone contained the STIL-TAL1 fusion and copy number loss of 9p21.3 (CDKN2A/CDKN2B locus), with other copy number alterations including loss of PTEN occurring as secondary subclonal events. In three cases, multiplex qPCR and phylogenetic analysis were used to produce branching evolutionary trees recapitulating the snapshot history of T-ALL evolution in this leukaemia subtype, which confirmed that mutations in key T-ALL drivers, including NOTCH1 and PTEN, were subclonal and reiterative in distinct subclones. Xenografting confirmed that self-renewing or propagating cells were genetically diverse. These data suggest that the STIL-TAL1 fusion is a likely founder or truncal event. Therapies targeting the TAL1 auto-regulatory complex are worthy of further investigation in T-ALL.",

    "abstract": "The catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) is a classical nonhomologous end-joining (cNHEJ) factor. Loss of DNA-PKcs diminished mature B cell class switch recombination (CSR) to other isotypes, but not IgG1.

High-throughput sequencing analyses of CSR junctions reveal frequent accumulation of nonproductive interchromosomal translocations, inversions, and extensive end resection in                 DNA-PKcs                  KD                  /                   KD                 , but not                 DNA-PKcs                  -/-                 , B cells.

    "abstract": "Rtt109 is a unique histone acetyltransferase acetylating histone H3 lysine 56 (H3K56), a modification critical for DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly and genome stability. In cells, histone chaperone Asf1 is essential for H3K56 acetylation, yet the mechanisms for H3K56 specificity and Asf1 requirement remain unknown. We have determined the crystal structure of the Rtt109-Asf1-H3-H4 complex and found that unwinding of histone H3 \u03b1                 N                , where K56 is normally located, and stabilization of the very C-terminal \u03b2 strand of histone H4 by Asf1 are prerequisites for H3K56 acetylation. Unexpectedly, an interaction between Rtt109 and the central helix of histone H3 is also required. The observed multiprotein, multisite substrate recognition mechanism among histone modification enzymes provides mechanistic understandings of Rtt109 and Asf1 in H3K56 acetylation, as well as valuable insights into\u00a0substrate recognition by histone modification enzymes in general.",

    "title": "Oncogenic hijacking of the stress response machinery in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia",
    "abstract": "Cellular transformation is accompanied by extensive rewiring of many biological processes leading to augmented levels of distinct types of cellular stress, including proteotoxic stress. Cancer cells critically depend on stress-relief pathways for their survival. However, the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional initiation and maintenance of the oncogenic stress response remain elusive. Here, we show that the expression of heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) and the downstream mediators of the heat shock response is transcriptionally upregulated in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Hsf1 ablation suppresses the growth of human T-ALL and eradicates leukemia in mouse models of T-ALL, while sparing normal hematopoiesis. HSF1 drives a compact transcriptional program and among the direct HSF1 targets, specific chaperones and co-chaperones mediate its critical role in T-ALL. Notably, we demonstrate that the central T-ALL oncogene NOTCH1 hijacks the cellular stress response machinery by inducing the expression of HSF1 and its downstream effectors. The NOTCH1 signaling status controls the levels of chaperone/co-chaperone complexes and predicts the response of T-ALL patient samples to HSP90 inhibition. Our data demonstrate an integral crosstalk between mediators of oncogene and non-oncogene addiction and reveal critical nodes of the heat shock response pathway that can be targeted therapeutically.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) accounts for up to 50% of brain parenchymal tumors. It is the most malignant type of brain cancer with very poor survival and limited remedies. Cancer subtyping is important for cancer research and therapy. Here, we report a new subtyping method for GBM based on the genetic alterations of CDKN2A and TP53 genes. CDKN2A and TP53 are the most frequently mutated genes with mutation rates of 60 and 30%, respectively. We found that patients with deletion of CDKN2A possess worse survival than those with TP53 mutation. Interestingly, survival of patients with both TP53 mutation and CDKN2A deletion is no worse than for those with only one of these genetic alterations, but similar to those with TP53 mutation alone. Next, we investigated differences in the gene expression profile between TP53 and CDKN2A samples. Consistent with the survival data, the samples with both TP53 mutation and CDKN2A deletion showed a gene expression profile similar to those samples with TP53 mutation alone. Finally, we found that activation of RAS pathway plus Cdkn2a/b silencing can induce GBM, in a similar way to tumor induction by RAS activation plus TP53 silencing. In conclusion, we show that the genetic alterations of CDKN2A and TP53 may be used to stratify GBM, and the new animal models matching this stratification method were generated.",

    "abstract": "Temozolomide (TMZ) was used for the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) for over a decade, but its treatment benefits are limited by acquired resistance, a process that remains incompletely understood. Here we report that an enhancer, located between the promoters of marker of proliferation Ki67 (MKI67) and O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) genes, is activated in TMZ-resistant patient-derived xenograft (PDX) lines and recurrent tumor samples. Activation of the enhancer correlates with increased MGMT expression, a major known mechanism for TMZ resistance. We show that forced activation of the enhancer in cell lines with low MGMT expression results in elevated MGMT expression. Deletion of this enhancer in cell lines with high MGMT expression leads to a dramatic reduction of MGMT and a lesser extent of Ki67 expression, increased TMZ sensitivity, and impaired proliferation. Together, these studies uncover a mechanism that regulates MGMT expression, confers TMZ resistance, and potentially regulates tumor proliferation.",

    "title": "MRI Is a DNA Damage Response Adaptor during Classical Non-homologous End Joining",
    "abstract": "The modulator of retrovirus infection (MRI or CYREN) is a 30-kDa protein with a conserved N-terminal Ku-binding motif (KBM) and a C-terminal XLF-like motif (XLM). We show that MRI is intrinsically disordered and interacts with many DNA damage response (DDR) proteins, including the kinases ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and DNA-PKcs and the classical non-homologous end joining (cNHEJ) factors Ku70, Ku80, XRCC4, XLF, PAXX, and XRCC4. MRI forms large multimeric complexes that depend on its N and C termini and localizes to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), where it promotes the retention of DDR factors. Mice deficient in MRI and XLF exhibit embryonic lethality at a stage similar to those deficient in the core cNHEJ factors XRCC4 or DNA ligase IV. Moreover, MRI is required for cNHEJ-mediated DSB repair in XLF-deficient lymphocytes. We propose that MRI is an adaptor that, through multivalent interactions, increases the avidity of DDR factors to DSB-associated chromatin to promote cNHEJ.",

Here we demonstrate that constitutively active NT5C2 mutations K359Q and L375F reconfigure the catalytic center for substrate access and catalysis in the absence of allosteric activator. In contrast, most relapse-associated mutations, which involve the arm segment and residues along the surface of the inter-monomeric cavity, disrupt a built-in switch-off mechanism responsible for turning off NT5C2. In addition, we show that the C-terminal acidic tail lost in the Q523X mutation functions to restrain NT5C2 activation. These results uncover dynamic mechanisms of enzyme regulation targeted by chemotherapy resistance-driving NT5C2 mutations, with important implications for the development of NT5C2 inhibitor therapies.",

    "abstract": "Bivalent chromatin domains containing repressive H3K27me3 and active H3K4me3 modifications are barriers for the expression of lineage-specific genes in ES cells and must be resolved for the transcription induction of these genes during differentiation, a process that remains largely unknown. Here, we show that Asf1a, a histone chaperone involved in nucleosome assembly and disassembly, regulates the resolution of bivalent domains and activation of lineage-specific genes during mouse ES cell differentiation. Deletion of Asf1a does not affect the silencing of pluripotent genes, but compromises the expression of lineage-specific genes during ES cell differentiation. Mechanistically, the Asf1a-histone interaction, but not the role of Asf1a in nucleosome assembly, is required for gene transcription. Asf1a is recruited to several bivalent promoters, partially through association with transcription factors, and mediates nucleosome disassembly during differentiation. We suggest that Asf1a-mediated nucleosome disassembly provides a means for resolution of bivalent domain barriers for induction of lineage-specific genes during differentiation.",

    "abstract": "One cause of cancer mortality is tumor evolution to therapy-resistant disease. First line therapy often targets the dominant clone, and drug resistance can emerge from preexisting clones that gain fitness through therapy-induced natural selection. Such mutations may be identified using targeted sequencing assays by analysis of noise in high-depth data. Here, we develop a comprehensive, unbiased model for sequencing error background. We find that noise in sufficiently deep DNA sequencing data can be approximated by aggregating negative binomial distributions. Mutations with frequencies above noise may have prognostic value. We evaluate our model with simulated exponentially expanded populations as well as data from cell line and patient sample dilution experiments, demonstrating its utility in prognosticating tumor progression. Our results may have the potential to identify significant mutations that can cause recurrence. These results are relevant in the pre-treatment clinical setting to determine appropriate therapy and prepare for potential recurrence pretreatment.",

    "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks repaired by non-homologous end joining display limited DNA end-processing and chromosomal mobility. By contrast, double-strand breaks undergoing homology-directed repair exhibit extensive processing and enhanced motion. The molecular basis of this movement is unknown. Here, using Xenopus laevis cell-free extracts and mammalian cells, we establish that nuclear actin, WASP, and the actin-nucleating ARP2/3 complex are recruited to damaged chromatin undergoing homology-directed repair. We demonstrate that nuclear actin polymerization is required for the migration of a subset of double-strand breaks into discrete sub-nuclear clusters. Actin-driven movements specifically affect double-strand breaks repaired by homology-directed repair in G2 cell cycle phase; inhibition of actin nucleation impairs DNA end-processing and homology-directed repair. By contrast, ARP2/3 is not enriched at double-strand breaks repaired by non-homologous end joining and does not regulate non-homologous end joining. Our findings establish that nuclear actin-based mobility shapes chromatin organization by generating repair domains that are essential for homology-directed repair in eukaryotic cells.",

Here, we show that the PRC2 complex is sequestered at poised enhancers, but not at active promoters with high levels of H3.3K27M proteins, thereby contributing to the global reduction of H3K27me3. Moreover, the levels of H3.3K27M proteins are low at the retained H3K27me3 peaks and consequently having minimal effects on the PRC2 activity at these loci. H3K27me3-mediated silencing at specific tumor suppressor genes, including Wilms Tumor 1, promotes proliferation of DIPG cells. These results support a model in which the PRC2 complex is redistributed to poised enhancers in H3.3K27M mutant cells and contributes to tumorigenesis in part by locally enhancing H3K27me3, and hence silencing of tumor suppressor genes.",

    "abstract": "Chordoid glioma (ChG) is a characteristic, slow growing, and well-circumscribed diencephalic tumor, whose mutational landscape is unknown. Here we report the analysis of 16 ChG by whole-exome and RNA-sequencing. We found that 15 ChG harbor the same PRKCA                 D463H                mutation. PRKCA encodes the Protein kinase C (PKC) isozyme alpha (PKC\u03b1) and is mutated in a wide range of human cancers. However the hot spot PRKCA                 D463H                mutation was not described in other tumors. PRKCA                 D463H                is strongly associated with the activation of protein translation initiation (EIF2) pathway. PKC\u03b1                 D463H                mRNA levels are more abundant than wild-type PKC\u03b1 transcripts, while PKC\u03b1                 D463H                is less stable than the PCK\u03b1                 WT                protein.

The PKC\u03b1                 D463H                mutant enhances proliferation of astrocytes and tanycytes, the cells of origin of ChG.

    "title": "Peli1 Modulates the Subcellular Localization and Activity of Mdmx",
    "abstract": "Mdm2 and Mdmx, both major repressors of p53 in human cancers, are predominantly localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively. The mechanism by which subcellular localization of Mdmx is regulated remains unclear. In this study, we identify the E3 ligase Peli1 as a major binding partner and regulator of Mdmx in human cells. Peli1 bound Mdmx                 in vitro                and                 in vivo                and promoted high levels of ubiquitination of Mdmx. Peli1-mediated ubiquitination was degradation-independent, promoting cytoplasmic localization of Mdmx, which in turn resulted in p53 activation. Consistent with this, knockdown or knockout Peli1 in human cancer cells induced nuclear localization of Mdmx and suppressed p53 activity. Myc-induced tumorigenesis was accelerated in Peli1-null mice and associated with downregulation of p53 function. Clinical samples of human cutaneous melanoma had decreased Peli1 expression, which was associated with poor overall survival. Together, these results demonstrate that Peli1 acts as a critical factor for the Mdmx-p53 axis by modulating the subcellular localization and activity of Mdmx, thus revealing a novel mechanism of Mdmx deregulation in human cancers.                 Significance:                Peli1-mediated regulation of Mdmx, a major inhibitor of p53, provides critical insight into activation of p53 function in human cancers.

    "abstract": "Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are PPAR\u03b3 agonists with potent insulin-sensitizing effects. However, their use has been curtailed by substantial adverse effects on weight, bone, heart, and hemodynamic balance. TZDs induce the deacetylation of PPAR\u03b3 on K268 and K293 to cause the browning of white adipocytes. Here, we show that targeted PPAR\u03b3 mutations resulting in constitutive deacetylation (K268R/K293R, 2KR) increased energy expenditure and protected from visceral adiposity and diet-induced obesity by augmenting brown remodeling of white adipose tissues. Strikingly, when 2KR mice were treated with rosiglitazone, they maintained the insulin-sensitizing, glucose-lowering response to TZDs, while displaying little, if any, adverse effects on fat deposition, bone density, fluid retention, and cardiac hypertrophy. Thus, deacetylation appears to fulfill the goal of dissociating the metabolic benefits of PPAR\u03b3 activation from its adverse effects. Strategies to leverage PPAR\u03b3 deacetylation may lead to the design of safer, more effective agonists of this nuclear receptor in the treatment of metabolic diseases.",

    "title": "Metastatic cancers promote cachexia through ZIP14 upregulation in skeletal muscle",
    "abstract": "Patients with metastatic cancer experience a severe loss of skeletal muscle mass and function known as cachexia. Cachexia is associated with poor prognosis and accelerated death in patients with cancer, yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we identify the metal-ion transporter ZRT- and IRT-like protein 14 (ZIP14) as a critical mediator of cancer-induced cachexia. ZIP14 is upregulated in cachectic muscles of mice and in patients with metastatic cancer and can be induced by TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2 cytokines. Strikingly, germline ablation or muscle-specific depletion of Zip14 markedly reduces muscle atrophy in metastatic cancer models. We find that ZIP14-mediated zinc uptake in muscle progenitor cells represses the expression of MyoD and Mef2c and blocks muscle-cell differentiation. Importantly, ZIP14-mediated zinc accumulation in differentiated muscle cells induces myosin heavy chain loss. These results highlight a previously unrecognized role for altered zinc homeostasis in metastatic cancer-induced muscle wasting and implicate ZIP14 as a therapeutic target for its treatment.",

    "abstract": "Dissecting the pathogenesis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), a common cancer in young adults, remains challenging because of the rarity of tumor cells in involved tissues (usually <5%). Here, we analyzed the coding genome of cHL by microdissecting tumor and normal cells from 34 patient biopsies for a total of \u223c50\u2009000 singly isolated lymphoma cells. We uncovered several recurrently mutated genes, namely,                 STAT6                (32% of cases),                 GNA13                (24%),                 XPO1                (18%), and                 ITPKB                (16%), and document the functional role of mutant STAT6 in sustaining tumor cell viability.

Overall, 87% of cases showed dysregulation of the JAK-STAT pathway by genetic alterations in multiple genes (also including                 STAT3                ,                 STAT5B                ,                 JAK1                ,                 JAK2                , and                 PTPN1                ), attesting to the pivotal role of this pathway in cHL pathogenesis and highlighting its potential as a new therapeutic target in this disease.",

    "abstract": "Over 80% of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) harbor a point mutation in histone H3.3 where lysine 27 is substituted with methionine (H3.3K27M); however, how the mutation affects kinetics and function of PcG proteins remains elusive. We demonstrate that H3.3K27M prolongs the residence time and search time of Ezh2, but has no effect on its fraction bound to chromatin. In contrast, H3.3K27M has no effect on the residence time of Cbx7, but prolongs its search time and decreases its fraction bound to chromatin. We show that increasing expression of Cbx7 inhibits the proliferation of DIPG cells and prolongs its residence time. Our results highlight that the residence time of PcG proteins directly correlates with their functions and the search time of PcG proteins is critical for regulating their genomic occupancy. Together, our data provide mechanisms in which the cancer-causing histone mutation alters the binding and search dynamics of epigenetic complexes.",

Over the past decade, remarkable progress has been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease, spurred by the implementation of powerful genomic technologies that enabled the definition of its genetic and epigenetic landscape. These studies have uncovered a multitude of genomic alterations that contribute to the initiation and maintenance of the tumor clone by disrupting biological functions known to be critical for the normal biology of its cells of origin, germinal center B cells. The identified alterations involve epigenetic remodeling, block of differentiation, escape from immune surveillance, and the constitutive activation of several signal transduction pathways. This wealth of new information offers unique opportunities for the development of improved diagnostic and prognostic tools that could help guide the clinical management of DLBCL patients. Furthermore, a number of the mutated genes identified are potentially actionable targets that are currently being explored for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This review summarizes current knowledge of the most common genetic alterations associated with DLBCL in relation to their functional impact on the malignant transformation process, and discusses their clinical implications for mechanism-based therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in cancer, but their propensity to couple their targets as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) has only recently emerged. Multiple models have studied ceRNA regulation, but these models did not account for the effects of co-regulation by miRNAs with many targets. We modeled ceRNA and simulated its effects using established parameters for miRNA/mRNA interaction kinetics while accounting for co-regulation by multiple miRNAs with many targets. Our simulations suggested that co-regulation by many miRNA species is more likely to produce physiologically relevant context-independent couplings. To test this, we studied the overlap of inferred ceRNA networks from four tumor contexts-our proposed pan-cancer ceRNA interactome (PCI). PCI was composed of interactions between genes that were co-regulated by nearly three-times as many miRNAs as other inferred ceRNA interactions. Evidence from expression-profiling datasets suggested that PCI interactions are predictive of gene expression in 12 independent tumor- and non-tumor contexts. Biochemical assays confirmed ceRNA couplings for two PCI subnetworks, including oncogenes CCND1, HIF1A\u00a0and HMGA2, and tumor suppressors PTEN, RB1\u00a0and TP53. Our results suggest that PCI is enriched for context-independent interactions that are coupled by many miRNA species and are more likely to be context independent.",

    "abstract": "High-risk neuroblastomas show a paucity of recurrent somatic mutations at diagnosis. As a result, the molecular basis for this aggressive phenotype remains elusive. Recent progress in regulatory network analysis helped us elucidate disease-driving mechanisms downstream of genomic alterations, including recurrent chromosomal alterations. Our analysis identified three molecular subtypes of high-risk neuroblastomas, consistent with chromosomal alterations, and identified subtype-specific master regulator proteins that were conserved across independent cohorts. A 10-protein transcriptional module-centered around a TEAD4-MYCN positive feedback loop-emerged as the regulatory driver of the high-risk subtype associated with                 MYCN                amplification. Silencing of either gene collapsed                 MYCN                -amplified (                 MYCN                 Amp                ) neuroblastoma transcriptional hallmarks and abrogated viability                 in vitro                and                 in vivo                Consistently, TEAD4 emerged as a robust prognostic marker of poor survival, with activity independent of the canonical Hippo pathway transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ. These results suggest novel therapeutic strategies for the large subset of MYCN-deregulated neuroblastomas.                 Significance:                Despite progress in understanding of neuroblastoma genetics, little progress has been made toward personalized treatment. Here, we present a framework to determine the downstream effectors of the genetic alterations sustaining neuroblastoma subtypes, which can be easily extended to other tumor types. We show the critical effect of disrupting a 10-protein module centered around a YAP/TAZ-independent TEAD4-MYCN positive feedback loop in                 MYCN                 Amp                neuroblastomas, nominating TEAD4 as a novel candidate for therapeutic intervention.

    "abstract": "All innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) require the small helix-loop-helix transcription factor ID2, but the functions of ID2 are not well understood in these cells. We show that mature natural killer (NK) cells, the prototypic ILCs, developed in mice lacking ID2 but remained as precursor CD27                 +                CD11b                 -                cells that failed to differentiate into CD27                 -                CD11b                 +                cytotoxic effectors. We show that ID2 limited chromatin accessibility at E protein binding sites near na\u00efve T lymphocyte-associated genes including multiple chemokine receptors, cytokine receptors, and signaling molecules and altered the NK cell response to inflammatory cytokines.

We demonstrate that ID3 was required for the development of ID2-deficient NK cells, indicating that completely unfettered E protein function is incompatible with NK cell development. These data solidify the roles of ID2 and ID3 as mediators of effector and na\u00efve gene programs, respectively, and revealed a critical role for ID2 in promoting a chromatin state and transcriptional program in CD27                 +                CD11b                 -                NK cells that supports cytotoxic effector differentiation and cytokine responses.",

    "abstract": "We propose a generic framework for gene regulatory network (GRN) inference approached as a feature selection problem. GRNs obtained using Machine Learning techniques are often dense, whereas real GRNs are rather sparse. We use a Tikonov regularization inspired optimal L-curve criterion that utilizes the edge weight distribution for a given target gene to determine the optimal set of TFs associated with it. Our proposed framework allows to incorporate a mechanistic active biding network based on cis-regulatory motif analysis. We evaluate our regularization framework in conjunction with two non-linear ML techniques, namely gradient boosting machines (GBM) and random-forests (GENIE), resulting in a regularized feature selection based method specifically called RGBM and RGENIE respectively. RGBM has been used to identify the main transcription factors that are causally involved as master regulators of the gene expression signature activated in the FGFR3-TACC3-positive glioblastoma. Here, we illustrate that RGBM identifies the main regulators of the molecular subtypes of brain tumors. Our analysis reveals the identity and corresponding biological activities of the master regulators characterizing the difference between G-CIMP-high and G-CIMP-low subtypes and between PA-like and LGm6-GBM, thus providing a clue to the yet undetermined nature of the transcriptional events among these subtypes.",

Using mutations, copy-number changes, mRNA expression, gene fusions and DNA methylation in 9,125 tumors profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we analyzed the mechanisms and patterns of somatic alterations in ten canonical pathways: cell cycle, Hippo, Myc, Notch, Nrf2, PI-3-Kinase/Akt, RTK-RAS, TGF\u03b2 signaling, p53 and \u03b2-catenin/Wnt. We charted the detailed landscape of pathway alterations in 33 cancer types, stratified into 64 subtypes, and identified patterns of co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity. Eighty-nine percent of tumors had at least one driver alteration in these pathways, and 57% percent of tumors had at least one alteration potentially targetable by currently available drugs. Thirty percent of tumors had multiple targetable alterations, indicating opportunities for combination therapy.",

    "abstract": "T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is a rare and poor-prognostic mature T-cell malignancy. Here we integrated large-scale profiling data of alterations in gene expression, allelic copy number (CN), and nucleotide sequences in 111 well-characterized patients. Besides prominent signatures of T-cell activation and prevalent clonal variants, we also identify novel hot-spots for CN variability, fusion molecules, alternative transcripts, and progression-associated dynamics. The overall lesional spectrum of T-PLL is mainly annotated to axes of DNA damage responses, T-cell receptor/cytokine signaling, and histone modulation. We formulate a multi-dimensional model of T-PLL pathogenesis centered around a unique combination of TCL1 overexpression with damaging ATM aberrations as initiating core lesions. The effects imposed by TCL1 cooperate with compromised ATM toward a leukemogenic phenotype of impaired DNA damage processing. Dysfunctional ATM appears inefficient in alleviating elevated redox burdens and telomere attrition and in evoking a p53-dependent apoptotic response to genotoxic insults. As non-genotoxic strategies, synergistic combinations of p53 reactivators and deacetylase inhibitors reinstate such cell death execution.",

    "abstract": "Loss-of-function mutations and deletions in Wilms tumor 1 (                 WT1                ) gene are present in approximately 10% of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Clinically,                 WT1                mutations are enriched in relapsed series and are associated to inferior relapse-free survival in thymic T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases. Here we demonstrate that WT1 plays a critical role in the response to DNA damage in T-cell leukemia.                 WT1                loss conferred resistance to DNA damaging agents and attenuated the transcriptional activation of important apoptotic regulators downstream of TP53 in                 TP53                -competent MOLT4 T-leukemia cells but not in                 TP53                -mutant T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines. Notably,                 WT1                loss positively affected the expression of the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, XIAP, and genetic or chemical inhibition with embelin (a XIAP inhibitor) significantly restored sensitivity to \u03b3-radiation in both T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. These results reveal an important role for the                 WT1                tumor suppressor gene in the response to DNA damage, and support the view that anti-XIAP targeted therapies could have a role in the treatment of                 WT1                -mutant T-cell leukemia.",

This DNA replication-coupled process is regulated by multitude of histone chaperones as well as by histone-modifying enzymes. In recent years novel insights into nucleosome assembly of new H3-H4 tetramers have been gained through studies on the classical histone chaperone CAF-1 and the identification of novel factors involved in this process. Moreover, in vitro reconstitution of chromatin replication has shed light on nucleosome assembly of parental H3-H4, a process that remains elusive. Finally, recent studies have revealed that the replication-coupled nucleosome assembly is important for the determination and maintenance of cell fate in multicellular organisms.",

    "abstract": "Relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is associated with resistance to chemotherapy and poor prognosis. Gain-of-function mutations in the 5'-nucleotidase, cytosolic II (NT5C2) gene induce resistance to 6-mercaptopurine and are selectively present in relapsed ALL. Yet, the mechanisms involved in NT5C2 mutation-driven clonal evolution during the initiation of leukaemia, disease progression and relapse remain unknown. Here we use a conditional-and-inducible leukaemia model to demonstrate that expression of NT5C2(R367Q), a highly prevalent relapsed-ALL NT5C2 mutation, induces resistance to chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine at the cost of impaired leukaemia cell growth and leukaemia-initiating cell activity. The loss-of-fitness phenotype of NT5C2                 +/R367Q                mutant cells is associated with excess export of purines to the extracellular space and depletion of the intracellular purine-nucleotide pool. Consequently, blocking guanosine synthesis by inhibition of inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) induced increased cytotoxicity against NT5C2-mutant leukaemia lymphoblasts. These results identify the fitness cost of NT5C2 mutation and resistance to chemotherapy as key evolutionary drivers that shape clonal evolution in relapsed ALL and support a role for IMPDH inhibition in the treatment of ALL.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase SHMT2, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in serine catabolism, drives cancer cell proliferation, but how this role is regulated is undefined. Here, we report that the sirtuin SIRT5 desuccinylates SHMT2 to increase its activity and drive serine catabolism in tumor cells. SIRT5 interaction directly mediated desuccinylation of lysine 280 on SHMT2, which was crucial for activating its enzymatic activity. Conversely, hypersuccinylation of SHMT2 at lysine 280 was sufficient to inhibit its enzymatic activity and downregulate tumor cell growth                 in vitro                and                 in vivo                Notably, SIRT5 inactivation led to SHMT2 enzymatic downregulation and to abrogated cell growth under metabolic stress. Our results reveal that SHMT2 desuccinylation is a pivotal signal in cancer cells to adapt serine metabolic processes for rapid growth, and they highlight SIRT5 as a candidate target for suppressing serine catabolism as a strategy to block tumor growth.                 Significance:                These findings reveal a novel mechanism for controlling cancer cell proliferation by blocking serine catabolism, as a general strategy to impede tumor growth.

    "title": "A metabolic function of FGFR3-TACC3 gene fusions in cancer",
    "abstract": "Chromosomal translocations that generate in-frame oncogenic gene fusions are notable examples of the success of targeted cancer therapies. We have previously described gene fusions of FGFR3-TACC3 (F3-T3) in 3% of human glioblastoma cases. Subsequent studies have reported similar frequencies of F3-T3 in many other cancers, indicating that F3-T3 is a commonly occuring fusion across all tumour types. F3-T3 fusions are potent oncogenes that confer sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors, but the downstream oncogenic signalling pathways remain unknown. Here we show that human tumours with F3-T3 fusions cluster within transcriptional subgroups that are characterized by the activation of mitochondrial functions. F3-T3 activates oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial biogenesis and induces sensitivity to inhibitors of oxidative metabolism. Phosphorylation of the phosphopeptide PIN4 is an intermediate step in the signalling pathway of the activation of mitochondrial metabolism. The F3-T3-PIN4 axis triggers the biogenesis of peroxisomes and the synthesis of new proteins. The anabolic response converges on the PGC1\u03b1 coactivator through the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species, which enables mitochondrial respiration and tumour growth. These data illustrate the oncogenic circuit engaged by F3-T3 and show that F3-T3-positive tumours rely on mitochondrial respiration, highlighting this pathway as a therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of tumours with F3-T3 fusions. We also provide insights into the genetic alterations that initiate the chain of metabolic responses that drive mitochondrial metabolism in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Although cell-cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis remain as major canonical activities of p53 in tumor suppression, the emerging role of p53 in metabolism has been a topic of great interest. Nevertheless, it is not completely understood how p53-mediated metabolic activities are regulated                 in vivo                and whether this part of the activities has an independent role beyond tumor suppression. Mdmx (also called Mdm4), like Mdm2, acts as a major suppressor of p53 but the embryonic lethality of mdmx-null mice creates difficulties to evaluate its physiological significance in metabolism. Here, we report that the embryonic lethality caused by the deficiency of                 mdmx                , in contrast to the case for                 mdm2                , is fully rescued in the background of                 p53                  3KR/3KR                 , an acetylation-defective mutant unable to induce cell-cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis.                 p53                  3KR/3KR                  /mdmx                  -/-                 mice are healthy but skinny without obvious developmental defects.                 p53                  3KR/3KR                  /mdmx                  -/-                 mice are resistant to fat accumulation in adipose tissues upon high fat diet. Notably, the levels of p53 protein are only slightly increased and can be further induced upon DNA damage in                 p53                  3KR/3KR                  /mdmx                  -/-                 mice, suggesting that Mdmx is only partially required for p53 degradation                 in vivo                . Further analyses indicate that the anti-obesity phenotypes in                 p53                  3KR/3KR                  /mdmx                  -/-                 mice are caused by activation of lipid oxidation and thermogenic programs in adipose tissues. These results demonstrate the specific effects of the p53/Mdmx axis in lipid metabolism and adipose tissue remodeling and reveal a surprising role of Mdmx inhibition in anti-obesity effects beyond, commonly expected, tumor suppression. Thus, our study has significant implications regarding Mdmx inhibitors in the treatment of obesity related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Inhibition of Mdm2 function is a validated approach to restore p53 activity for cancer therapy; nevertheless, inhibitors of Mdm2 such as Nutlin-3 have certain limitations, suggesting that additional targets in this pathway need to be further elucidated. Our finding that the Herpesvirus-Associated Ubiquitin-Specific Protease (HAUSP, also called USP7) interacts with the p53/Mdm2 protein complex, was one of the first examples that deubiquitinases (DUBs) exhibit a specific role in regulating protein stability. Here, we show that inhibitors of HAUSP and Nutlin-3 can synergistically activate p53 function and induce p53-dependent apoptosis in human cancer cells. Notably, HAUSP can also target the N-Myc oncoprotein in a p53-independent manner. Moreover, newly synthesized HAUSP inhibitors are more potent than the commercially available inhibitors to suppress N-Myc activities in p53 mutant cells for growth suppression. Taken together, our study demonstrates the utility of HAUSP inhibitors to target cancers in both a p53-depdentent and -independent manner.",

    "title": "Landscape of the regulatory elements for lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation pathway",
    "abstract": "Short-chain fatty acids and their corresponding acyl-CoAs sit at the crossroads of metabolic pathways and play important roles in diverse cellular processes. They are also precursors for protein post-translational lysine acylation modifications. A noteworthy example is the newly identified lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation (K                 hib                ) that is derived from 2-hydroxyisobutyrate and 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA. Histone K                 hib                has been shown to be associated with active gene expression in spermatogenic cells. However, the key elements that regulate this post-translational lysine acylation pathway remain unknown. This has hindered characterization of the mechanisms by which this modification exerts its biological functions. Here we show that Esa1p in budding yeast and its homologue Tip60 in human could add K                 hib                to substrate proteins both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we have identified HDAC2 and HDAC3 as the major enzymes to remove K                 hib                . Moreover, we report the first global profiling of K                 hib                proteome in mammalian cells, identifying 6 548 K                 hib                sites on 1 725 substrate proteins. Our study has thus discovered both the \"writers\" and \"erasers\" for histone K                 hib                marks, and major K                 hib                protein substrates. These results not only illustrate the landscape of this new lysine acylation pathway, but also open new avenues for studying diverse functions of cellular metabolites associated with this pathway.",

These mutant histones are also termed oncohistones. Since oncohistone proteins co-exist with wild type histone proteins in cells, it is critically important to understand how they promote tumorigenesis. Here, we describe two methods to analyze the impact of these oncohistones on histone modification and epigenome, including the expression of oncohistone from a transgene and the utilization of CRISPR/Cas9 system to knock-in specific oncohistone mutations. The methods described are useful for the initial characterization of oncohistones. Other methods such as ChIP-seq and RNA-seq, which analyze the effect of oncohistone mutations genome wide, are not detailed in this protocol.",

    "abstract": "DNA replication initiates at DNA replication origins after unwinding of double-strand DNA(dsDNA) by replicative helicase to generate single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) templates for the continuous synthesis of leading-strand and the discontinuous synthesis of lagging-strand. Therefore, methods capable of detecting strand-specific information will likely yield insight into the association of proteins at leading and lagging strand of DNA replication forks and the regulation of leading and lagging strand synthesis during DNA replication. The enrichment and Sequencing of Protein-Associated Nascent DNA (eSPAN), which measure the relative amounts of proteins at nascent leading and lagging strands of DNA replication forks, is a step-wise procedure involving the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of a protein of interest followed by the enrichment of protein-associated nascent DNA through BrdU immunoprecipitation. The isolated ssDNA is then subjected to strand-specific sequencing. This method can detect whether a protein is enriched at leading or lagging strand of DNA replication forks. In addition to eSPAN, two other strand-specific methods, (ChIP-ssSeq), which detects potential protein-ssDNA binding and BrdU-IP-ssSeq, which can measure synthesis of both leading and lagging strand, were developed along the way. These methods can provide strand-specific and complementary information about the association of the target protein with DNA replication forks as well as synthesis of leading and lagging strands genome wide.

The approach has been relatively well established but several key steps still require further improvement.

Current ChIP protocols typically yield nanogram quantities of immunoprecipitated DNA mainly depending on the target of interest and starting chromatin input amount. However, little information exists on the performance of reagents used for the purification of such minute amounts of immunoprecipitated DNA in ChIP elution buffer and their effects on ChIP-seq data. Here, we compared DNA recovery, library preparation efficiency, and ChIP-seq results obtained with several commercial DNA purification reagents applied to 1\u00a0ng ChIP DNA and also investigated the impact of conditions under which ChIP DNA is stored.",

These small molecules of the heterocyclic diamidine family disrupted the interaction of PU.1 with target gene promoters and led to downregulation of canonical PU.1 transcriptional targets. shRNA or small-molecule inhibition of PU.1 in AML cells from either PU.1lo mutant mice or human patients with AML-inhibited cell growth and clonogenicity and induced apoptosis. In murine and human AML (xeno)transplantation models, treatment with our PU.1 inhibitors decreased tumor burden and resulted in increased survival.

    "abstract": "Although probability of event-free survival in pediatric lymphoblastic T-cell lymphoma (T-LBL) is about 75%, survival in relapsed patients is very poor, so the identification of new molecular markers is crucial for treatment optimization. Here, we demonstrated that the over-expression of                 miR-223                promotes tumor T-LBL cell growth, migration and invasion                 in vitro                . We found out that SIK1, an anti-metastatic protein, is a direct target of                 miR-223                and consequently is significantly reduced in                 miR-223                -overexpressing tumor cells. We measured                 miR-223                expression levels at diagnosis in tumor biopsies from 67 T-LBL pediatric patients for whom complete clinical and follow up data were available, and we found that high                 miR-223                expression (above the median value) is associated with worse prognosis (PFS 66% vs 94%, P=0.0036). In addition, the multivariate analysis, conducted taking into account                 miR-223                expression level and other molecular and clinical characteristics, showed that only high level of                 miR-223                is an independent factor for worse prognosis.

    "title": "Huwe1 Regulates the Establishment and Maintenance of Spermatogonia by Suppressing DNA Damage Response",
    "abstract": "Spermatogenesis is sustained by a heterogeneous population of spermatogonia that includes the spermatogonial stem cells. However, the mechanisms underlying their establishment from gonocyte embryonic precursors and their maintenance thereafter remain largely unknown. In this study, we report that inactivation of the ubiquitin ligase Huwe1 in male germ cells in mice led to the degeneration of spermatogonia in neonates and resulted in a Sertoli cell-only phenotype in the adult. Huwe1 knockout gonocytes showed a decrease in mitotic re-entry, which inhibited their transition to spermatogonia. Inactivation of Huwe1 in primary spermatogonial culture or the C18-4 cell line resulted in cell degeneration. Degeneration of Huwe1 knockout spermatogonia was associated with an increased level of histone H2AX and an elevated DNA damage response that led to apparent mitotic catastrophe but not apoptosis or senescence. Blocking this increase in H2AX prevented the degeneration of Huwe1-depleted cells. Taken together, these results reveal a previously undefined role of Huwe1 in orchestrating the physiological DNA damage response in the male germline that contributes to the establishment and maintenance of spermatogonia.",

    "abstract": "The checkpoint kinase Rad53 is activated during replication stress to prevent fork collapse, an essential but poorly understood process. Here we show that Rad53 couples leading- and lagging-strand synthesis under replication stress. In rad53-1 cells stressed by dNTP depletion, the replicative DNA helicase, MCM, and the leading-strand DNA polymerase, Pol \u03b5, move beyond the site of DNA synthesis, likely unwinding template DNA. Remarkably, DNA synthesis progresses further along the lagging strand than the leading strand, resulting in the exposure of long stretches of single-stranded leading-strand template. The asymmetric DNA synthesis in rad53-1 cells is suppressed by elevated levels of dNTPs in\u00a0vivo, and the activity of Pol \u03b5 is compromised more than lagging-strand polymerase Pol \u03b4 at low dNTP concentrations in\u00a0vitro. Therefore, we propose that Rad53 prevents the generation of excessive ssDNA under replication stress by coordinating DNA unwinding with synthesis of both strands.",

When DNA replication stress is encountered, DNA synthesis stalls until the stress is ameliorated. However, it is not known whether there is a difference in the association of each polymerase with active and stalled replication forks. Here, we show that each DNA polymerase has a distinct pattern of association with active and stalled replication forks. Pol \u03b1 is enriched at extending Okazaki fragments of active and stalled forks. In contrast, although Pol \u03b4 contacts the nascent lagging strands of active and stalled forks, it binds to only the matured (and not elongating) Okazaki fragments of stalled forks. Pol \u03b5 has greater contact with the nascent single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) of the leading strand on active forks than on stalled forks. We propose that the configuration of DNA polymerases at stalled forks facilitates the resumption of DNA synthesis after stress removal.",

Availability of fully generalizable approaches for the systematic and efficient prioritization of tumor-context specific protein activity inhibitors would thus have significant translational value. Unfortunately, inhibitor effects on protein activity cannot be directly measured in systematic and proteome-wide fashion by conventional biochemical assays. We introduce OncoLead, a novel network based approach for the systematic prioritization of candidate inhibitors for arbitrary targets of therapeutic interest. In vitro and in vivo validation confirmed that OncoLead analysis can recapitulate known inhibitors as well as prioritize novel, context-specific inhibitors of difficult targets, such as MYC and STAT3. We used OncoLead to generate the first unbiased drug/regulator interaction map, representing compounds modulating the activity of cancer-relevant transcription factors, with potential in precision medicine.",

The accessibility of tumor cells obtained from peripheral blood or through bone marrow aspirates, together with recent advances in cancer genomics and single-cell molecular analysis, have facilitated the study of clonal populations and their genetic and epigenetic evolution over time with unprecedented detail. The results of these analyses challenge the classic view of leukemia as a clonal homogeneous diffuse tumor and introduce a more complex and dynamic scenario. In this review, we present current concepts on the role of clonal evolution in lymphoid and myeloid leukemia as a driver of tumor initiation, disease progression and relapse.

    "abstract": "Although ARF can suppress tumor growth by activating p53 function, the mechanisms by which it suppresses tumor growth independently of p53 are not well understood. Here, we identified ARF as a key regulator of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) through complex purification. ARF inhibits the ability of NRF2 to transcriptionally activate its target genes, including SLC7A11, a component of the cystine/glutamate antiporter that regulates reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced ferroptosis. As a consequence, ARF expression sensitizes cells to ferroptosis in a p53-independent manner while ARF depletion induces NRF2 activation and promotes cancer cell survival in response to oxidative stress. Moreover, the ability of ARF to induce p53-independent tumor growth suppression in mouse xenograft models is significantly abrogated upon NRF2 overexpression. These results demonstrate that NRF2 is a major target of p53-independent tumor suppression by ARF and also suggest that the ARF-NRF2 interaction acts as a new checkpoint for oxidative stress responses.",

    "abstract": "Chondroblastoma is a cartilaginous tumor that typically arises under 25\u00a0y of age (80%). Recent studies have identified a somatic and heterozygous mutation at the H3F3B gene in over 90% chondroblastoma cases, leading to a lysine 36 to methionine replacement (H3.3K36M). In human cells, H3F3B gene is one of 2 genes that encode identical H3.3 proteins. It is not known how H3.3K36M mutant proteins promote tumorigenesis. We and others have shown that, the levels of H3K36 di- and tri-methylation (H3K36me2/me3) are reduced dramatically in chondroblastomas and chondrocytes bearing the H3.3K36M mutation. Mechanistically, H3.3K36M mutant proteins inhibit enzymatic activity of some, but not all H3K36 methyltransferases. Chondrocytes harboring the same H3F3B mutation exhibited the cancer cell associated phenotypes. Here, we discuss the potential effects of H3.3K36M mutation on epigenomes including H3K36 and H3K27 methylation and cellular phenotypes. We suggest that H3.3K36M mutant proteins alter epigenomes of specific progenitor cells, which in turn lead to cellular transformation and tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitination-directed protein degradation is important in many cancers for tumor initiation and maintenance, and E3 ligases containing HECT domains are emerging as new therapeutic targets. In contrast to many other E3 ligases, the role of HUWE1 in ovarian cancer where HUWE1 is dysregulated has been unclear. Here we report that genetic deletion of Huwe1 in the mouse inhibits transformation of ovary surface epithelium cells without significantly affecting cell survival and apoptosis, and that Huwe1 deletion after tumors have been initiated inhibits tumor growth. In Huwe1-deficient cells, expression of histone H1.3 increased, inhibiting the expression of noncoding RNA                 H19                 H19                silencing phenocopied the effects of Huwe1 deficiency, whereas H1.3 silencing partially rescued the expression of                 H19                and the Huwe1-null phenotype. Inducible silencing of HUWE1 in human ovarian cancer cells produced a similar phenotype. Mechanistically, HUWE1 bound and ubiquitinated H1.3, which was consequently marked for destruction by proteasomes. Our results establish that HUWE1 plays an essential role in promoting ovarian cancer.                 Cancer Res; 77(18); 4773-84. \u00a92017 AACR                .",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) comprises distinct subtypes characterized by their molecular profile. Mesenchymal identity in GBM has been associated with a comparatively unfavorable prognosis, primarily due to inherent resistance of these tumors to current therapies. The identification of molecular determinants of mesenchymal transformation could potentially allow for the discovery of new therapeutic targets. Zinc Finger and BTB Domain Containing 18 (ZBTB18/ZNF238/RP58) is a zinc finger transcriptional repressor with a crucial role in brain development and neuronal differentiation. Here, ZBTB18 is primarily silenced in the mesenchymal subtype of GBM through aberrant promoter methylation. Loss of ZBTB18 contributes to the aggressive phenotype of glioblastoma through regulation of poor prognosis-associated signatures. Restitution of ZBTB18 expression reverses the phenotype and impairs tumor-forming ability. These results indicate that ZBTB18 functions as a tumor suppressor in GBM through the regulation of genes associated with phenotypically aggressive properties.                 Implications:                This study characterizes the role of the putative tumor suppressor ZBTB18 and its regulation by promoter hypermethylation, which appears to be a common mechanism to silence ZBTB18 in the mesenchymal subtype of GBM and provides a new mechanistic opportunity to specifically target this tumor subclass.

The cPcdh topologically associated domain (TAD                 cPcdh                ) in neurons from mutant mice showed abnormal accumulation of the transcriptional regulator and three-dimensional (3D) genome organizer CTCF at cryptic binding sites, in conjunction with DNA cytosine hypomethylation, histone hyperacetylation and upregulated expression. Genes encoding stochastically expressed protocadherins were transcribed by increased numbers of cortical neurons, indicating relaxation of single-cell constraint. SETDB1-dependent loop formations bypassed 0.2-1 Mb of linear genome and radiated from the TAD                 cPcdh                fringes toward cis-regulatory sequences within the cPcdh locus, counterbalanced shorter-range facilitative promoter-enhancer contacts and carried loop-bound polymorphisms that were associated with genetic risk for schizophrenia.

    "abstract": "Pharmacological and functional genomic screens play an essential role in the discovery and characterization of therapeutic targets and associated pharmacological inhibitors. Although these screens affect thousands of gene products, the typical readout is based on low complexity rather than genome-wide assays. To address this limitation, we introduce pooled library amplification for transcriptome expression (PLATE-Seq), a low-cost, genome-wide mRNA profiling methodology specifically designed to complement high-throughput screening assays. Introduction of sample-specific barcodes during reverse transcription supports pooled library construction and low-depth sequencing that is 10- to 20-fold less expensive than conventional RNA-Seq. The use of network-based algorithms to infer protein activity from PLATE-Seq data results in comparable reproducibility to 30\u2009M read sequencing. Indeed, PLATE-Seq reproducibility compares favorably to other large-scale perturbational profiling studies such as the connectivity map and library of integrated network-based cellular signatures.Despite the importance of pharmacological and functional genomic screens the readouts are of low complexity.

    "title": "The \"readers\" of unacetylated p53 represent a new class of acidic domain proteins",
    "abstract": "Acetylation of non-histone proteins plays important roles in regulating protein functions but the mechanisms of action are poorly understood. Our recent study uncovered a previously unknown mechanism by which C-terminal domain (CTD) acetylation of p53 serves as a \"switch\" to determine the interaction between a unique group of acidic domain-containing proteins and p53, as well as revealed that acidic domains may act as a novel class of \"readers\" for unacetylated p53. However, the properties of acidic domain \"readers\" are not well elucidated yet. Here, we identified that the charge effect between acidic domain \"readers\" and the p53 CTD is necessary for their interaction. Both the length and the amino acid composition of a given acidic domain contributed to its ability to recognize the p53 CTD. Finally, we summarized the characteristic features of our identified acidic domains, which would distinguish this kind of \"readers\" from other types of acidic amino acid-containing domains.",

    "abstract": "Studies on genetic-epigenetic interactions, including the mapping of methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) and haplotype-dependent allele-specific DNA methylation (hap-ASM), have become a major focus in the post-genome-wide-association-study (GWAS) era. Such maps can nominate regulatory sequence variants that underlie GWAS signals for common diseases, ranging from neuropsychiatric disorders to cancers. Conversely, mQTLs need to be filtered out when searching for non-genetic effects in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). Sequence variants in CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and transcription factor binding sites have been mechanistically linked to mQTLs and hap-ASM. Identifying these sites can point to disease-associated transcriptional pathways, with implications for targeted treatment and prevention.",

    "title": "The B-cell receptor controls fitness of MYC-driven lymphoma cells via GSK3\u03b2 inhibition",
    "abstract": "Similar to resting mature B cells, where the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) controls cellular survival, surface BCR expression is conserved in most mature B-cell lymphomas. The identification of activating BCR mutations and the growth disadvantage upon BCR knockdown of cells of certain lymphoma entities has led to the view that BCR signalling is required for tumour cell survival. Consequently, the BCR signalling machinery has become an established target in the therapy of B-cell malignancies. Here we study the effects of BCR ablation on MYC-driven mouse B-cell lymphomas and compare them with observations in human Burkitt lymphoma. Whereas BCR ablation does not, per se, significantly affect lymphoma growth, BCR-negative (BCR                 -                ) tumour cells rapidly disappear in the presence of their BCR-expressing (BCR                 +                ) counterparts in vitro and in vivo. This requires neither cellular contact nor factors released by BCR                 +                tumour cells. Instead, BCR loss induces the rewiring of central carbon metabolism, increasing the sensitivity of receptor-less lymphoma cells to nutrient restriction. The BCR attenuates glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3\u03b2) activity to support MYC-controlled gene expression. BCR                 -                tumour cells exhibit increased GSK3\u03b2 activity and are rescued from their competitive growth disadvantage by GSK3\u03b2 inhibition. BCR                 -                lymphoma variants that restore competitive fitness normalize GSK3\u03b2 activity after constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway, commonly through Ras mutations. Similarly, in Burkitt lymphoma, activating RAS mutations may propagate immunoglobulin-crippled tumour cells, which usually represent a minority of the tumour bulk. Thus, while BCR expression enhances lymphoma cell fitness, BCR-targeted therapies may profit from combinations with drugs targeting BCR                 -                tumour cells.",

The resulting indirect regulatory influence between miRNA targets resembles competition and has been dubbed competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA). Recent studies have questioned the physiological relevance of ceRNA interactions, our ability to accurately predict these interactions, and the number of genes that are impacted by ceRNA interactions in specific cellular contexts.",

However, the specific role of                 NOTCH1                in leukemogenesis remains to be established. Here, we report that the active intracellular portion of NOTCH1 (ICN1) is detectable in \u223c50% of peripheral blood CLL cases lacking gene mutations. We identify a \"NOTCH1 gene-expression signature\" in CLL cells, and show that this signature is significantly enriched in primary CLL cases expressing ICN1, independent of                 NOTCH1                mutation. NOTCH1 target genes include key regulators of B-cell proliferation, survival, and signal transduction. In particular, we show that NOTCH1 transactivates                 MYC                via binding to B-cell-specific regulatory elements, thus implicating this oncogene in CLL development. These results significantly extend the role of                 NOTCH1                in CLL pathogenesis, and have direct implications for specific therapeutic targeting.",

    "abstract": "Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive chromosome breakage disorder caused by mutations in the ATM gene. Typically, it presents in early childhood with progressive cerebellar dysfunction along with immunodeficiency and oculocutaneous telangiectasia. An increased risk of malignancy is also associated with the syndrome and, rarely, may be the presenting feature in small children. We describe a 17-year-old boy with slurred speech, mild motor delays and learning disability diagnosed with atypical A-T in the setting of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Suspicion for A-T was raised after review of a peripheral blood karyotype demonstrating rearrangements involving chromosomes 7 and/or 14. The diagnosis was confirmed after molecular testing identified a novel homozygous missense variant in ATM (c.5585T>A; p.Leu1862His) that resulted in protein instability and abolished serine/threonine protein kinase activity. To our knowledge, this is the first report of concurrent A-T and lymphoid malignancy diagnoses in an older child or adult with only mild neurological disease. Our experience suggests that screening for the disorder should be considered in any individual with lymphoid malignancy and neurological findings, especially as radiation and certain chemotherapy protocols are contraindicated in A-T.",

    "abstract": "Somatic cells can be reprogrammed to a pluripotent state by nuclear transfer into oocytes, yet developmental arrest often occurs. While incomplete transcriptional reprogramming is known to cause developmental failure, reprogramming also involves concurrent changes in cell cycle progression and nuclear structure. Here we study cellular reprogramming events in human and mouse nuclear transfer embryos prior to embryonic genome activation. We show that genetic instability marked by frequent chromosome segregation errors and DNA damage arise prior to, and independent of, transcriptional activity. These errors occur following transition through DNA replication and are repaired by BRCA1. In the absence of mitotic nuclear remodelling, DNA replication is delayed and errors are exacerbated in subsequent mitosis. These results demonstrate that independent of gene expression, cell-type-specific features of cell cycle progression constitute a barrier sufficient to prevent the transition from one cell type to another during reprogramming.",

However, this proposition is complicated by spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Here we study genomic and expression profiles across 127 multisector or longitudinal specimens from 52 individuals with glioblastoma (GBM). Using bulk and single-cell data, we find that samples from the same tumor mass share genomic and expression signatures, whereas geographically separated, multifocal tumors and/or long-term recurrent tumors are seeded from different clones. Chemical screening of patient-derived glioma cells (PDCs) shows that therapeutic response is associated with genetic similarity, and multifocal tumors that are enriched with PIK3CA mutations have a heterogeneous drug-response pattern. We show that targeting truncal events is more efficacious than targeting private events in reducing the tumor burden. In summary, this work demonstrates that evolutionary inference from integrated genomic analysis in multisector biopsies can inform targeted therapeutic interventions for patients with GBM.",

Here, we review this rapidly expanding field of research and discuss the unique biological and clinical features conferred to isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type glioma cells by FGFR-TACC fusions. FGFR-TACC fusions generate powerful oncogenes that combine growth-promoting effects with aneuploidy through the activation of as yet unclear intracellular signaling mechanisms. FGFR-TACC fusions appear to be clonal tumor-initiating events that confer strong sensitivity to FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Screening assays have recently been reported for the accurate identification of FGFR-TACC fusion variants in human cancer, and early clinical data have shown promising effects in cancer patients harboring FGFR-TACC fusions and treated with FGFR inhibitors. Thus, FGFR-TACC gene fusions provide a \"low-hanging fruit\" model for the validation of precision medicine paradigms in human GBM.",

To generate animal models that reproduce the human tumors more faithfully than rodents, we present the first report of a cancer model mimicking human tumor genetics in tree shrew. By engineering a lentiviral system for the transduction of mutant H-Ras and a shRNA against tree shrew p53, we successfully generated malignant glioma in tree shrew. The tree shrew glioma exhibited aggressive behavior and a relatively short latency, and markedly reduced animal survival. Remarkably, the biological features of human high-grade glioma (necrosis, microvascular proliferation, pseudopalisading) were all present in tree shrew glioma. Furthermore, genetic analysis of tree shrew glioma revealed that the tumors were clustered within the mesenchymal subgroup of human glioblastoma multiforme. Compared with the corresponding mouse glioma, tree shrew gliomas were markedly more similar to human glioblastoma at gene expression profile. The tree shrew glioma model provides colleagues working in the field of gliomas and cancer in general with a more accurate animal model.",

    "abstract": "Biological networks contribute effectively to unveil the complex structure of molecular interactions and to discover driver genes especially in cancer context. It can happen that due to gene mutations, as for example when cancer progresses, the gene expression network undergoes some amount of localized re-wiring. The ability to detect statistical relevant changes in the interaction patterns induced by the progression of the disease can lead to the discovery of novel relevant signatures. Several procedures have been recently proposed to detect sub-network differences in pairwise labeled weighted networks.",

    "abstract": "T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a highly proliferative hematologic malignancy that results from the transformation of immature T-cell progenitors. Aberrant cell growth and proliferation in T-ALL lymphoblasts are sustained by activation of strong oncogenic drivers promoting cell anabolism and cell cycle progression. Oncogenic NOTCH signaling, which is activated in more than 65% of T-ALL patients by activating mutations in the                 NOTCH1                gene, has emerged as a major regulator of leukemia cell growth and metabolism. T-ALL                 NOTCH1                mutations result in ligand-independent and sustained NOTCH1-receptor signaling, which translates into activation of a broad transcriptional program dominated by upregulation of genes involved in anabolic pathways. Among these, the                 MYC                oncogene plays a major role in NOTCH1-induced transformation. As result, the oncogenic activity of NOTCH1 in T-ALL is strictly dependent on MYC upregulation, which makes the NOTCH1-MYC regulatory circuit an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of T-ALL.",

    "title": "The CREBBP Acetyltransferase Is a Haploinsufficient Tumor Suppressor in B-cell Lymphoma",
    "abstract": "Inactivating mutations of the CREBBP acetyltransferase are highly frequent in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL), the two most common germinal center (GC)-derived cancers. However, the role of CREBBP inactivation in lymphomagenesis remains unclear. Here, we show that CREBBP regulates enhancer/super-enhancer networks with central roles in GC/post-GC cell fate decisions, including genes involved in signal transduction by the B-cell receptor and CD40 receptor, transcriptional control of GC and plasma cell development, and antigen presentation. Consistently,                 Crebbp                -deficient B cells exhibit enhanced response to mitogenic stimuli and perturbed plasma cell differentiation. Although GC-specific loss of                 Crebbp                was insufficient to initiate malignant transformation, compound                 Crebbp                -haploinsufficient/BCL2-transgenic mice, mimicking the genetics of FL and DLBCL, develop clonal lymphomas recapitulating the features of the human diseases. These findings establish                 CREBBP                as a haploinsufficient tumor-suppressor gene in GC B cells and provide insights into the mechanisms by which its loss contributes to lymphomagenesis.                 Significance:                Loss-of-function mutations of                 CREBBP                are common and early lesions in FL and DLBCL, suggesting a prominent role in lymphoma initiation. Our studies identify the cellular program by which reduced CREBBP dosage facilitates malignant transformation, and have direct implications for targeted lymphoma therapy based on drugs affecting CREBBP-mediated chromatin acetylation.

We describe here the synthesis and testing of potential small-molecule pan-RAS ligands, which were designed to interact with adjacent sites on the surface of oncogenic KRAS. One compound, termed 3144, was found to\u00a0bind to RAS proteins using microscale thermophoresis, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry and to exhibit lethality in cells partially dependent on expression of RAS proteins. This compound was metabolically stable in liver microsomes and displayed anti-tumor activity in xenograft mouse cancer models.

Here we performed an expression-based virtual screening to identify highly active antileukemic drugs that synergize with NOTCH1 inhibition in T-ALL. Among these, withaferin A demonstrated the strongest cytotoxic and GSI-synergistic antileukemic effects in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, network perturbation analyses showed eIF2A-phosphorylation-mediated inhibition of protein translation as a critical mediator of the antileukemic effects of withaferin A and its interaction with NOTCH1 inhibition. Overall, these results support a role for anti-NOTCH1 therapies and protein translation inhibitor combinations in the treatment of T-ALL.",

Based on leading USP7 inhibitors P5091 and P22077, we designed and synthesized a series of thiazole derivatives. The results of in vitro assays showed that the thiazole compounds exhibited low micromolar inhibition activity against both USP7 enzyme and cancer cell lines. The compounds induced cell death in a p53-dependent and p53-independent manner. Taken together, this study may provide thiazole compounds as a new class of USP7 inhibitors.",

Here we review epigenetic effects of chromosomal aneuploidies, focusing on findings in Down syndrome (DS, trisomy 21). Recent work in human DS and mouse models has shown that the extra chromosome 21 acts in trans to produce epigenetic changes, including differential CpG methylation (DS-DM), in specific sets of downstream target genes, mostly on other chromosomes. Mechanistic hypotheses emerging from these data include roles of chromosome 21-linked methylation pathway genes (DNMT3L and others) and transcription factor genes (RUNX1, OLIG2, GABPA, ERG and ETS2) in shaping the patterns of DS-DM. The findings may have broader implications for trans-acting epigenetic effects of chromosomal and subchromosomal aneuploidies in other human developmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, and in cancers.",

Although numerous studies indicate that the MDM2 E3 ligase activity, as well as the protein-protein interaction between p53 and MDM2, is the major focus for this regulation, emerging evidence suggests that the deubiquitinase herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP, also known as USP7) plays a critical role. Furthermore, HAUSP inhibition elevates p53 stability and might be beneficial for therapeutic purposes. In this review, we discuss the advances of this dynamic pathway and the contributions of positive and negative regulators affecting HAUSP activity. We also highlight the roles of HAUSP in cancer justifying the production of the first generation of HAUSP inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Endometriosis is characterized by growth of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterine cavity. Since its pathogenesis may involve epigenetic changes, we used Illumina 450K Methylation Beadchips to profile CpG methylation in endometriosis stromal cells compared to stromal cells from normal endometrium. We validated and extended the Beadchip data using bisulfite sequencing (bis-seq), and analyzed differential methylation (DM) at the CpG-level and by an element-level classification for groups of CpGs in chromatin domains. Genes found to have DM included examples encoding transporters (SLC22A23), signaling components (BDNF, DAPK1, ROR1, and WNT5A) and transcription factors (GATA family, HAND2, HOXA cluster, NR5A1, OSR2, TBX3). Intriguingly, among the TF genes with DM we also found JAZF1, a proto-oncogene affected by chromosomal translocations in endometrial stromal tumors. Using RNA-Seq we identified a subset of the DM genes showing differential expression (DE), with the likelihood of DE increasing with the extent of the DM and its location in enhancer elements. Supporting functional relevance, treatment of stromal cells with the hypomethylating drug 5aza-dC led to activation of DAPK1 and SLC22A23 and repression of HAND2, JAZF1, OSR2, and ROR1 mRNA expression. We found that global 5hmC is decreased in endometriotic versus normal epithelial but not stroma cells, and for JAZF1 and BDNF examined by oxidative bis-seq, found that when 5hmC is detected, patterns of 5hmC paralleled those of 5mC. Together with prior studies, these results define a consistent epigenetic signature in endometriosis stromal cells and nominate specific transcriptional and signaling pathways as therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "The histone chaperone HIRA is involved in depositing histone variant H3.3 into distinct genic regions, including promoters, enhancers, and gene bodies. However, how HIRA deposits H3.3 to these regions remains elusive. Through a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screening, we identified single-stranded DNA binding protein replication protein A (RPA) as a regulator of the deposition of newly synthesized H3.3 into chromatin. We show that RPA physically interacts with HIRA to form RPA-HIRA-H3.3 complexes, and it co-localizes with HIRA and H3.3 at gene promoters and enhancers. Depletion of RPA1, the largest subunit of the RPA complex, dramatically reduces both HIRA association with chromatin and the deposition of newly synthesized H3.3 at promoters and enhancers and leads to altered transcription at gene promoters. These results support a model whereby RPA, best known for its role in DNA replication and repair, recruits HIRA to promoters and enhancers and regulates deposition of newly synthesized H3.3 to these regulatory elements for gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "DNA replication is tightly regulated to occur once and only once per cell cycle. How chromatin, the physiological substrate of DNA replication machinery, regulates DNA replication remains largely unknown. Here we show that histone H3 lysine 9 demethylase Kdm4d regulates DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. Depletion of Kdm4d results in defects in DNA replication, which can be rescued by the expression of H3K9M, a histone H3 mutant transgene that reverses the effect of Kdm4d on H3K9 methylation. Kdm4d interacts with replication proteins, and its recruitment to DNA replication origins depends on the two pre-replicative complex components (origin recognition complex [ORC] and minichromosome maintenance [MCM] complex). Depletion of Kdm4d impairs the recruitment of Cdc45, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and polymerase \u03b4, but not ORC and MCM proteins. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which Kdm4d regulates DNA replication by reducing the H3K9me3 level to facilitate formation of pre-initiative complex.",

    "abstract": "Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) regulates the DNA damage response as well as DNA double-strand break repair through homologous recombination. Here we show that ATM is hyperactive when the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) is chemically inhibited or when the DNA-PKcs gene is deleted in human cells. Pre-incubation of ATM protein with active DNA-PKcs also significantly reduces ATM activity in\u00a0vitro. We characterize several phosphorylation sites in ATM that are targets of DNA-PKcs and show that phospho-mimetic mutations at these residues significantly inhibit ATM activity and impair ATM signaling upon DNA damage. In contrast, phospho-blocking mutations at one cluster of sites increase the frequency of apoptosis during normal cell growth. DNA-PKcs, which is integral to the non-homologous end joining pathway, thus negatively regulates ATM activity through phosphorylation of ATM. These observations illuminate an important regulatory mechanism for ATM that also controls DNA repair pathway choice.",

PAXX is the newest NHEJ factor, which shares structural similarity with known NHEJ factors-XRCC4 and XLF. Here we report that PAXX is dispensable for physiological NHEJ in otherwise wild-type mice. Yet Paxx                 -/-                mice require XLF and Xlf                 -/-                mice require PAXX for end-ligation.

    "abstract": "Genomic studies have identified recurrent somatic mutations in acute leukemias. However, current murine models do not sufficiently encompass the genomic complexity of human leukemias. To develop preclinical models, we transplanted 160 samples from patients with acute leukemia (acute myeloid leukemia, mixed lineage leukemia, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, T-cell ALL) into immunodeficient mice. Of these, 119 engrafted with expected immunophenotype. Targeted sequencing of 374 genes and 265 frequently rearranged RNAs detected recurrent and novel genetic lesions in 48 paired primary tumor (PT) and patient-derived xenotransplant (PDX) samples. Overall, the frequencies of 274 somatic variant alleles correlated between PT and PDX samples, although the data were highly variable for variant alleles present at 0-10%. Seventeen percent of variant alleles were detected in either PT or PDX samples only. Based on variant allele frequency changes, 24 PT-PDX pairs were classified as concordant while the other 24 pairs showed various degree of clonal discordance. There was no correlation of clonal concordance with clinical parameters of diseases. Significantly more bone marrow samples than peripheral blood samples engrafted discordantly. These data demonstrate the utility of developing PDX banks for modeling human leukemia, and emphasize the importance of genomic profiling of PDX and patient samples to ensure concordance before performing mechanistic or therapeutic studies.",

The functional consequences of the majority of mutations identified by such projects remain an open, unexplored question. This problem is particularly complicated in the case of rare mutations where frequency of occurrence alone or prediction of functional consequences are insufficient to distinguish driver from passenger or bystander mutations. We combine genome editing technology with a powerful mouse cancer model to uncover previously unsuspected rare oncogenic mutations in Burkitt's lymphoma. We identify two candidate tumor suppressors whose loss cooperate with MYC over-expression to accelerate lymphomagenesis. Our results highlight the utility of in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 screens combined with powerful mouse models to identify and validate rare oncogenic modifier events from tumor mutational data.",

    "abstract": "Histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) is expressed in B cells, and its overexpression has been observed in B-lymphoproliferative disorders, including B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). We examined HDAC9 protein expression and copy number alterations in primary B-NHL samples, identifying high HDAC9 expression among various lymphoma entities and HDAC9 copy number gains in 50% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). To study the role of HDAC9 in lymphomagenesis, we generated a genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model that constitutively expressed an HDAC9 transgene throughout B-cell development under the control of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) enhancer (E\u03bc). Here, we report that the E\u03bc-HDAC9 GEM model develops splenic marginal zone lymphoma and lymphoproliferative disease (LPD) with progression towards aggressive DLBCL, with gene expression profiling supporting a germinal center cell origin, as is also seen in human B-NHL tumors. Analysis of E\u03bc-HDAC9 tumors suggested that HDAC9 might contribute to lymphomagenesis by altering pathways involved in growth and survival, as well as modulating BCL6 activity and p53 tumor suppressor function. Epigenetic modifications play an important role in the germinal center response, and deregulation of the B-cell epigenome as a consequence of mutations and other genomic aberrations are being increasingly recognized as important steps in the pathogenesis of a variety of B-cell lymphomas. A thorough mechanistic understanding of these alterations will inform the use of targeted therapies for these malignancies. These findings strongly suggest a role for HDAC9 in B-NHL and establish a novel GEM model for the study of lymphomagenesis and, potentially, preclinical testing of therapeutic approaches based on histone deacetylase inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Foxp3+ T-regulatory (Treg) cells are known to suppress protective host immune responses to a wide variety of solid tumors, but their therapeutic targeting is largely restricted to their transient depletion or \"secondary\" modulation, e.g. using anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody. Our ongoing studies of the post-translational modifications that regulate Foxp3 demonstrated that the histone/protein acetyltransferase, Tip60, plays a dominant role in promoting acetylation, dimerization and function in Treg cells. We now show that the ubiquitin-specific protease, Usp7, controls Treg function largely by stabilizing the expression and promoting the multimerization of Tip60 and Foxp3. Genetic or pharmacologic targeting of Usp7 impairs Foxp3+ Treg suppressive functions, while conventional T cell responses remain intact. As a result, pharmacologic inhibitors of Usp7 can limit tumor growth in immunocompetent mice, and promote the efficacy of antitumor vaccines and immune checkpoint therapy with anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody in murine models. Hence, pharmacologic therapy with Usp7 inhibitors may have an important role in future cancer immunotherapy.",

We identified the ubiquitin ligase Huwe1 as a crucial regulator of HSC function via its post-translational control of the oncoprotein N-myc (encoded by Mycn). We found Huwe1 to be essential for HSC self-renewal, quiescence and lymphoid-fate specification in mice. Through the use of a fluorescent fusion allele (Mycn                 M                ), we observed that N-myc expression was restricted to the most immature, multipotent stem and progenitor populations. N-myc expression was upregulated in response to stress or following loss of Huwe1, which led to increased proliferation and stem-cell exhaustion. Mycn depletion reversed most of these phenotypes in vivo, which suggested that the attenuation of N-myc by Huwe1 is essential for reestablishing homeostasis following stress.",

    "abstract": "Although p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis remain critical barriers to cancer development, the emerging role of p53 in cell metabolism, oxidative responses, and ferroptotic cell death has been a topic of great interest. Nevertheless, it is unclear how p53 orchestrates its activities in multiple metabolic pathways into tumor suppressive effects. Here, we identified the SAT1 (spermidine/spermine N                 1                -acetyltransferase 1) gene as a transcription target of p53. SAT1 is a rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine catabolism critically involved in the conversion of spermidine and spermine back to putrescine. Surprisingly, we found that activation of SAT1 expression induces lipid peroxidation and sensitizes cells to undergo ferroptosis upon reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced stress, which also leads to suppression of tumor growth in xenograft tumor models. Notably, SAT1 expression is down-regulated in human tumors, and CRISPR-cas9-mediated knockout of SAT1 expression partially abrogates p53-mediated ferroptosis. Moreover, SAT1 induction is correlated with the expression levels of arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15), and SAT1-induced ferroptosis is significantly abrogated in the presence of PD146176, a specific inhibitor of ALOX15. Thus, our findings uncover a metabolic target of p53 involved in ferroptotic cell death and provide insight into the regulation of polyamine metabolism and ferroptosis-mediated tumor suppression.",

    "title": "Acetylation-regulated interaction between p53 and SET reveals a widespread regulatory mode",
    "abstract": "Although lysine acetylation is now recognized as a general protein modification for both histones and non-histone proteins, the mechanisms of acetylation-mediated actions are not completely understood. Acetylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of p53 (also known as TP53) was an early example of non-histone protein acetylation and its precise role remains unclear. Lysine acetylation often creates binding sites for bromodomain-containing 'reader' proteins. Here we use a proteomic screen to identify the oncoprotein SET as a major cellular factor whose binding with p53 is dependent on CTD acetylation status. SET profoundly inhibits p53 transcriptional activity in unstressed cells, but SET-mediated repression is abolished by stress-induced acetylation of p53 CTD. Moreover, loss of the interaction with SET activates p53, resulting in tumour regression in mouse xenograft models. Notably, the acidic domain of SET acts as a 'reader' for the unacetylated CTD of p53 and this mechanism of acetylation-dependent regulation is widespread in nature. For example, acetylation of p53 also modulates its interactions with similar acidic domains found in other p53 regulators including VPRBP (also known as DCAF1), DAXX and PELP1 (refs. 7, 8, 9), and computational analysis of the proteome has identified numerous proteins with the potential to serve as acidic domain readers and lysine-rich ligands. Unlike bromodomain readers, which preferentially bind the acetylated forms of their cognate ligands, the acidic domain readers specifically recognize the unacetylated forms of their ligands. Finally, the acetylation-dependent regulation of p53 was further validated in vivo by using a knock-in mouse model expressing an acetylation-mimicking form of p53. These results reveal that acidic-domain-containing factors act as a class of acetylation-dependent regulators by targeting p53 and, potentially, other proteins.",

    "abstract": "Although previous studies indicate that loss of p53-mediated cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence does not completely abrogate its tumor suppression function, it is unclear how the remaining activities of p53 are regulated. Here, we have identified an acetylation site at lysine K98 in mouse p53 (or K101 for human p53). Whereas the loss of K98 acetylation (p53                 K98R                ) alone has very modest effects on p53-mediated transactivation, simultaneous mutations at all four acetylation sites (p53                 4KR                : K98R+ 3KR[K117R+K161R+K162R]) completely abolish its ability to regulate metabolic targets, such as TIGAR and SLC7A11. Notably, in contrast to p53                 3KR                , p53                 4KR                is severely defective in suppressing tumor growth in mouse xenograft models. Moreover, p53                 4KR                is still capable of inducing the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop, but p53-dependent ferroptotic responses are markedly abrogated.

    "title": "Mutational landscape, clonal evolution patterns, and role of RAS mutations in relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia",
    "abstract": "Although multiagent combination chemotherapy is curative in a significant fraction of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients, 20% of cases relapse and most die because of chemorefractory disease. Here we used whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing to analyze the mutational landscape at relapse in pediatric ALL cases. These analyses identified numerous relapse-associated mutated genes intertwined in chemotherapy resistance-related protein complexes. In this context, RAS-MAPK pathway-activating mutations in the neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS), kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), and protein tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 11 (PTPN11) genes were present in 24 of 55 (44%) cases in our series. Interestingly, some leukemias showed retention or emergence of RAS mutant clones at relapse, whereas in others RAS mutant clones present at diagnosis were replaced by RAS wild-type populations, supporting a role for both positive and negative selection evolutionary pressures in clonal evolution of RAS-mutant leukemia. Consistently, functional dissection of mouse and human wild-type and mutant RAS isogenic leukemia cells demonstrated induction of methotrexate resistance but also improved the response to vincristine in mutant RAS-expressing lymphoblasts. These results highlight the central role of chemotherapy-driven selection as a central mechanism of leukemia clonal evolution in relapsed ALL, and demonstrate a previously unrecognized dual role of RAS mutations as drivers of both sensitivity and resistance to chemotherapy.",

    "title": "HAUSP deubiquitinates and stabilizes N-Myc in neuroblastoma",
    "abstract": "The MYCN proto-oncogene is amplified in a number of advanced-stage human tumors, such as neuroblastomas. Similar to other members of the MYC family of oncoproteins, MYCN (also known as N-Myc) is a transcription factor, and its stability and activity are tightly controlled by ubiquitination-dependent proteasome degradation. Although numerous studies have demonstrated that N-Myc is a driver of neuroblastoma tumorigenesis, therapies that directly suppress N-Myc activity in human tumors are limited. Here we have identified ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7; also known as HAUSP) as a regulator of N-Myc function in neuroblastoma. HAUSP interacts with N-Myc, and HAUSP expression induces deubiquitination and subsequent stabilization of N-Myc. Conversely, RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of USP7 in neuroblastoma cancer cell lines, or genetic ablation of Usp7 in the mouse brain, destabilizes N-Myc, which leads to inhibition of N-Myc function. Notably, HAUSP is more abundant in patients with neuroblastoma who have poorer prognosis, and HAUSP expression substantially correlates with N-Myc transcriptional activity. Furthermore, small-molecule inhibitors of HAUSP's deubiquitinase activity markedly suppress the growth of MYCN-amplified human neuroblastoma cell lines in xenograft mouse models. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a crucial role of HAUSP in regulating N-Myc function in vivo and suggest that HAUSP inhibition is a potential therapy for MYCN-amplified tumors.",

    "title": "Monitoring Metastasis and Cachexia in a Patient with Breast Cancer: A Case Study",
    "abstract": "Cachexia, a wasting syndrome associated with advanced cancer and metastasis, is rarely documented in breast cancer patients. However, the incidence of cachexia in breast cancer is now thought to be largely underestimated. In our case report of a breast cancer patient with bone metastasis monitored during the course of her treatment, we document the development of cachexia by image analysis in relation to her metastatic burden. Elucidation of the link between metastatic burden and cachexia could unveil a highly specific screening process for metastasis, by assessing true muscle mass loss. Our patient was a 49-year-old premenopausal woman, with metastatic invasive ductal breast carcinoma in the vertebral and iliac bones on presentation, which progressed with new metastases to her hips, thigh bones, and vertebrae. In the two-year period, that is between her diagnosis and death, she lost >10% of her baseline weight. During these two years, we retrospectively identified a decrease in paraspinal muscle (PM) at the third lumbar vertebra followed by a sharp decline in weight. The increased tumor burden over time in metastatic sites was accompanied by a decrease in abdominal muscle and visceral and subcutaneous fat and was followed by the patient's demise. The increasing tumor burden in the patient was correlated with the mass of other tissues to determine the tissue that could best serve as a surrogate marker to cachexia and tumor burden. We noted a strong negative correlation between PM area and metastatic tumor area at the third lumbar vertebral level, with PM loss correlating to increasing tumor burden. The monitoring of PM wasting may serve as a marker, and therefore a prognostic factor, for both cachexia and extent of metastatic disease, especially in breast cancer, where metastasis to bone is frequent. Based on our data and review of the literature in this case study, longitudinal monitoring of cachexia in the selected muscle groups can give clinicians early indications of the extent of cachexia in metastatic breast cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Nodal marginal zone lymphoma (NMZL) is a rare, indolent B-cell tumor that is distinguished from splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) by the different pattern of dissemination. NMZL still lacks distinct markers and remains orphan of specific cancer gene lesions. By combining whole-exome sequencing, targeted sequencing of tumor-related genes, whole-transcriptome sequencing, and high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis, we aimed at disclosing the pathways that are molecularly deregulated in NMZL and we compare the molecular profile of NMZL with that of SMZL. These analyses identified a distinctive pattern of nonsilent somatic lesions in NMZL. In 35 NMZL patients, 41 genes were found recurrently affected in \u22653 (9%) cases, including highly prevalent molecular lesions of MLL2 (also known as KMT2D; 34%), PTPRD (20%), NOTCH2 (20%), and KLF2 (17%). Mutations of PTPRD, a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase regulating cell growth, were enriched in NMZL across mature B-cell tumors, functionally caused the loss of the phosphatase activity of PTPRD, and were associated with cell-cycle transcriptional program deregulation and increased proliferation index in NMZL. Although NMZL shared with SMZL a common mutation profile, NMZL harbored PTPRD lesions that were otherwise absent in SMZL. Collectively, these findings provide new insights into the genetics of NMZL, identify PTPRD lesions as a novel marker for this lymphoma across mature B-cell tumors, and support the distinction of NMZL as an independent clinicopathologic entity within the current lymphoma classification.",

    "title": "An analysis of the relationship between metastases and cachexia in lung cancer patients",
    "abstract": "Weight loss and hematogenous metastases are poor prognosis factors in lung cancer patients that can but do not necessarily co-occur. We retrospectively investigated the clinical association between cachexia, tumor characteristics (such as metastatic burden and mutational status), and treatment in lung cancer patients. The medical records of 394 lung cancer patients from two institutions (Columbia University, USA and Tohoku University, Japan) were reviewed. Information collected included the presence of cachexia, histologic subtype, tumor stage, number of metastases, mutation status, treatment, and survival. Descriptive statistics were performed. Only stage IV patients exhibited >5% weight loss (0.8%, 2.2%, 3.6%, and 5.1%, for stages I to IV; P\u00a0=\u00a00.0001). Patients with metastases developed cachexia more often than patients without metastases independent of treatment (6.0% and 7.1% weight loss in patients with metastases vs. 2.5% and 2.0% in patients without metastases, before [P\u00a0=\u00a00.0001] and after [P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001] treatment, respectively). The change in number of metastatic sites over time correlated with increasing weight loss (5.2%, 10.6%, 13.4%, and 13.4%, for an increase of 0, 1, 2, and \u22653 metastatic sites, from initial diagnosis to the endpoint; P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Patients with cachexia had worse survival than patients without cachexia (hazard ratio, 2.94; 95% confidence interval, 2.08-4.16; P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Tumors with mutated KRAS were associated with an increased risk of weight loss (11.4% weight loss in patients with mutated KRAS vs. 6.0% in patients with wild-type KRAS; P\u00a0=\u00a00.0011). Our findings suggest that the capabilities of lung cancer to metastasize and cause cachexia might be linked intrinsically and are independent of treatments administered. KRAS-mutated tumors were more commonly associated with cachexia.",

Here, we investigated the possible correlation between TIM-3 expression by                 ex vivo                cytotoxic T cells (CTL) from follicular lymphoma (FL) biopsies and their functional unresponsiveness that could limit the favorable impact of CTL on disease progression. We report a high percentage of CD8                 +                TIM-3                 +                T cells in lymph nodes of FL patients.

Furthermore, CD8                 +                TIM-3                 +                T cells display                 ex vivo                markers of lytic granule release and remain unresponsive to further TCR-induced activation of the lytic machinery. Although confocal microscopy showed that TIM-3 expression on CD8                 +                T cells correlated with minor alterations of immunological synapse, a selective reduction of ERK signaling in CD8                 +                TIM-3                 +                T cells was observed by phospho-flow analysis.

    "abstract": "The receptor Notch1 plays an important role in malignant progression of many cancers, but its regulation is not fully understood. In this study, we report that the kinase HIPK2 is responsible for facilitating the Fbw7-dependent proteasomal degradation of Notch1 by phosphorylating its intracellular domain (Notch1-IC) within the Cdc4 phosphodegron motif. Notch1-IC expression was higher in cancer cells than normal cells. Under genotoxic stress, Notch1-IC was phosphorylated constitutively by HIPK2 and was maintained at a low level through proteasomal degradation. HIPK2 phosphorylated the residue T2512 in Notch1-IC. Somatic mutations near this residue rendered Notch1-IC resistant to degradation, as induced either by HIPK2 overexpression or adriamycin treatment. In revealing an important mechanism of Notch1 stability, the results of this study could offer a therapeutic strategy to block Notch1-dependent progression in many types of cancer.

BCL6 protein stability is regulated by F-box protein 11 (FBXO11)-mediated ubiquitination and degradation, which is impaired in \u223c6% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas that carry inactivating genetic alterations targeting the FBXO11 gene. In order to investigate the role of FBXO11 in vivo, we analyzed GC-specific FBXO11 knockout mice. FBXO11 reduction or loss led to an increased number of GC B cells, to an altered ratio of GC dark zone to light zone cells, and to higher levels of BCL6 protein in GC B cells. B-cell receptor-mediated degradation of BCL6 was reduced in the absence of FBXO11, suggesting that FBXO11 contributes to the physiologic downregulation of BCL6 at the end of the GC reaction. Finally, FBXO11 inactivation was associated with the development of lymphoproliferative disorders in mice.",

    "abstract": "Plasmablastic lymphoma is a rare and aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma commonly associated with Epstein-Barr virus co-infection that most often occurs in the context of human immunodeficiency virus infection. Therefore, its immune escape strategy may involve the upregulation of immune-checkpoint proteins allowing the tumor immune evasion. However, the expression of these molecules was poorly studied in this lymphoma. We have investigated 82 plasmablastic lymphoma cases of whom half were Epstein-Barr virus positive. Although they harbored similar pathological features, Epstein-Barr virus positive plasmablastic lymphomas showed a significant increase in MYC gene rearrangement and had a better 2-year event-free survival than Epstein-Barr virus negative cases (P=0.049). Immunostains for programmed cell death-1, programmed cell death-ligand 1, indole 2,3-dioxygenase and dendritic cell specific C-type lectin showed a high or moderate expression by the microenvironment cells in 60%-72% of cases, whereas CD163 was expressed in almost all cases. Tumor cells also expressed programmed cell death-1 and its ligand in 22.5% and 5% of cases, respectively. Both Epstein-Barr virus positive and negative plasmablastic lymphomas exhibited a high immune-checkpoint score showing that it involves several pathways of immune escape. However, Epstein-Barr virus positive lymphomas exhibited a higher expression of programmed cell death-1 and its ligand in both malignant cells and microenvironment as compared to Epstein-Barr virus negative cases. In conclusion, plasmablastic lymphoma expresses immune-checkpoint proteins through both malignant cells and the tumor microenvironment. The expression of programmed cell death-1 and its ligand constitutes a strong rationale for testing monoclonal antibodies in this often chemoresistant disease.",

However, accurate inference of aberrant protein activity in biological samples is still challenging as genetic alterations are only partially predictive and direct measurements of protein activity are generally not feasible. To address this problem we introduce and experimentally validate a new algorithm, virtual inference of protein activity by enriched regulon analysis (VIPER), for accurate assessment of protein activity from gene expression data. We used VIPER to evaluate the functional relevance of genetic alterations in regulatory proteins across all samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In addition to accurately infer aberrant protein activity induced by established mutations, we also identified a fraction of tumors with aberrant activity of druggable oncoproteins despite a lack of mutations, and vice versa. In vitro assays confirmed that VIPER-inferred protein activity outperformed mutational analysis in predicting sensitivity to targeted inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common form of B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma worldwide and comprises a heterogeneous group of malignancies that originate from the malignant transformation of germinal center (GC) B cells. Over the past decade, significant improvement has been achieved in our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis underlying this disease, thanks in part to the implementation of powerful genomic technologies allowing genome-wide structural and functional analyses. These studies revealed the presence of multiple oncogenic alterations dysregulating signal transduction pathways that are normally required for the normal biology of the cells from which these tumors are derived. Among the pathways identified as recurrent targets of genetic lesions in DLBCL, NF-\u03baB has emerged as a central player in the development and maintenance of this disease, particularly in the less curable, activated B cell (ABC)- like subtype. These lesions reveal vulnerabilities of the lymphoma cells that can be exploited for the design of more rationale therapeutic approaches. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent progresses in understanding the role of NF-\u03baB deregulation in the pathogenesis of DLBCL, with emphasis on the genetic basis underlying its aberrant activation, in relationship to the normal biology of B lymphocytes, and the modelling of these lesions in the mouse.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is an intracellular degradation system that delivers cytoplasmic constituents to the lysosome, and loss of autophagy has been linked to increased genome instability. Here, we report that loss of autophagy is coupled to reduced histone H2A ubiquitination after DNA damage. p62/SQSTM1, which accumulates in autophagy-defective cells, directly binds to and inhibits nuclear RNF168, an E3 ligase essential for histone H2A ubiquitination and DNA damage responses. As a result, DNA repair proteins such as BRCA1, RAP80, and Rad51 cannot be recruited to the sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which impairs DSB repair. Moreover, nuclear-localized p62 increased the sensitivity of tumor cells to radiation both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, and this required its interaction with RNF168. Our findings indicate that autophagy-deficiency-induced p62 accumulation results in inhibition of histone ubiquitination and highlight the complex relationship between autophagy and the DNA damage response.",

MMP-25 (membrane-type 6-MMP) is a membrane-bound enzyme predominantly expressed in leukocytes whose biological function has remained largely unknown. We have generated Mmp25-deficient mice to elucidate the in vivo function of this protease. These mutant mice are viable and fertile and do not show any spontaneous phenotype. However, Mmp25-null mice exhibit a defective innate immune response characterized by low sensitivity to bacterial LPS, hypergammaglobulinemia, and reduced secretion of proinflammatory molecules. Moreover, these immune defects can be tracked to a defective NF-\u03baB activation observed in Mmp25-deficient leukocytes. Globally, our findings provide new mechanistic insights into innate immunity through the activity of MMP-25, suggesting that this proteinase could be a potential therapeutic target for immune-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor. To better understand how GBM evolves, we analyzed longitudinal genomic and transcriptomic data from 114 patients. The analysis shows a highly branched evolutionary pattern in which 63% of patients experience expression-based subtype changes. The branching pattern, together with estimates of evolutionary rate, suggests that relapse-associated clones typically existed years before diagnosis. Fifteen percent of tumors present hypermutation at relapse in highly expressed genes, with a clear mutational signature. We find that 11% of recurrence tumors harbor mutations in LTBP4, which encodes a protein binding to TGF-\u03b2. Silencing LTBP4 in GBM cells leads to suppression of TGF-\u03b2 activity and decreased cell proliferation. In recurrent GBM with wild-type IDH1, high LTBP4 expression is associated with worse prognosis, highlighting the TGF-\u03b2 pathway as a potential therapeutic target in GBM.",

Transcription factors of the E-protein and Id families are important arbiters of T cell development, but their role in the differentiation of the TH1 and TFH subsets of helper T cells is not well understood. Here, TH1 cells showed more robust Id2 expression than that of TFH cells, and depletion of Id2 via RNA-mediated interference increased the frequency of TFH cells. Furthermore, TH1 differentiation was blocked by Id2 deficiency, which led to E-protein-dependent accumulation of effector cells with mixed characteristics during viral infection and severely impaired the generation of TH1 cells following infection with Toxoplasma gondii. The TFH cell-defining transcriptional repressor Bcl6 bound the Id2 locus, which provides a mechanism for the bimodal Id2 expression and reciprocal development of TH1 cells and TFH cells.",

Deregulation of proto-oncogene expression after a translocation, most notably to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus (IGH), is one of the hallmarks of DLBCL. Using whole-genome sequencing analysis, we have identified the PD-L1/PD-L2 locus as a recurrent translocation partner for IGH in DLBCL. PIM1 and TP63 were also identified as novel translocation partners for PD-L1/PD-L2 Fluorescence in situ hybridization was furthermore used to rapidly screen an expanded DLBCL cohort. Collectively, a subset of samples was found to be affected by gains (12%), amplifications (3%), and translocations (4%) of the PD-L1/PD-L2 locus. RNA sequencing data coupled with immunohistochemistry revealed that these cytogenetic alterations correlated with increased expression of PD-L1 but not of PD-L2 Moreover, cytogenetic alterations affecting the PD-L1/PD-L2 locus were more frequently observed in the non-germinal center B cell-like (non-GCB) subtype of DLBCL. These findings demonstrate the genetic basis of PD-L1 overexpression in DLBCL and suggest that treatments targeting the PD-1-PD-L1/PD-L2 axis might benefit DLBCL patients, especially those belonging to the more aggressive non-GCB subtype.",

Here we report that 72% of cancer-associated ATM mutations are missense mutations that are enriched around the kinase domain. Expression of kinase-dead ATM (Atm(KD/-)) is more oncogenic than loss of ATM (Atm(-/-)) in mouse models, leading to earlier and more frequent lymphomas with Pten deletions. Kinase-dead ATM protein (Atm-KD), but not loss of ATM (Atm-null), prevents replication-dependent removal of Topo-isomerase I-DNA adducts at the step of strand cleavage, leading to severe genomic instability and hypersensitivity to Topo-isomerase I inhibitors. Correspondingly, Topo-isomerase I inhibitors effectively and preferentially eliminate Atm(KD/-), but not Atm-proficientor Atm(-/-) leukemia in animal models. These findings identify ATM kinase-domain missense mutations as a potent oncogenic event and a biomarker for Topo-isomerase I inhibitor based therapy.",

Through its role in DNA end resection, CtIP facilitates DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination (DSBR-HR) and microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). In addition, however, CtIP has also been implicated in the formation of aberrant chromosomal rearrangements in an MMEJ-dependent manner, an activity that could potentially promote tumor development by increasing genome instability. To clarify whether CtIP acts in vivo to suppress or promote tumorigenesis, we have examined its oncogenic potential in mouse models of human breast cancer. Surprisingly, mice heterozygous for a null Ctip allele did not display an increased susceptibility to tumor formation. Moreover, mammary-specific biallelic CtIP ablation did not elicit breast tumors in a manner reminiscent of BRCA1 loss. Instead, CtIP inactivation dramatically reduced the kinetics of mammary tumorigenesis in mice bearing mammary-specific lesions of the p53 gene. Thus, unlike other repair factors, CtIP is not a tumor suppressor, but has oncogenic properties that can promote tumorigenesis, consistent with its ability to facilitate MMEJ-dependent chromosomal instability. Consequently, inhibition of CtIP-mediated MMEJ may prove effective against tumor types, such as human breast cancer, that display MMEJ-dependent chromosomal rearrangements.",

    "abstract": "Parkin, a ubiquitin E3 ligase, is mutated in most cases of autosomal recessive early onset Parkinson disease. It was discovered that Parkin is also mutated in glioblastoma and other human malignancies and that it inhibits tumor cell growth. Here, we identified pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) as a unique substrate for parkin through biochemical purification. We found that parkin interacts with PKM2 both in vitro and in vivo, and this interaction dramatically increases during glucose starvation. Ubiquitylation of PKM2 by parkin does not affect its stability but decreases its enzymatic activity. Parkin regulates the glycolysis pathway and affects the cell metabolism. Our studies revealed the novel important roles of parkin in tumor cell metabolism and provided new insight for therapy of Parkinson disease.",

    "abstract": "Haplotype-dependent allele-specific methylation (hap-ASM) can impact disease susceptibility, but maps of this phenomenon using stringent criteria in disease-relevant tissues remain sparse. Here we apply array-based and Methyl-Seq approaches to multiple human tissues and cell types, including brain, purified neurons and glia, T lymphocytes, and placenta, and identify 795 hap-ASM differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and 3,082 strong methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs), most not previously reported. More than half of these DMRs have cell type-restricted ASM, and among them are 188 hap-ASM DMRs and 933 mQTLs located near GWAS signals for immune and neurological disorders. Targeted bis-seq confirmed hap-ASM in 12/13 loci tested, including CCDC155, CD69, FRMD1, IRF1, KBTBD11, and S100A(\u2217)-ILF2, associated with immune phenotypes, MYT1L, PTPRN2, CMTM8 and CELF2, associated with neurological disorders, NGFR and HLA-DRB6, associated with both immunological and brain disorders, and ZFP57, a trans-acting regulator of genomic imprinting. Polymorphic CTCF and transcription factor (TF) binding sites were over-represented among hap-ASM DMRs and mQTLs, and analysis of the human data, supplemented by cross-species comparisons to macaques, indicated that CTCF and TF binding likelihood predicts the strength and direction of the allelic methylation asymmetry. These results show that hap-ASM is highly tissue specific; an important trans-acting regulator of genomic imprinting is regulated by this phenomenon; and variation in CTCF and TF binding sites is an underlying mechanism, and maps of hap-ASM and mQTLs reveal regulatory sequences underlying supra- and sub-threshold GWAS peaks in immunological and neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "Mutations disabling the TP53 tumour suppressor gene represent the most frequent events in human cancer and typically occur through a two-hit mechanism involving a missense mutation in one allele and a 'loss of heterozygosity' deletion encompassing the other. While TP53 missense mutations can also contribute gain-of-function activities that impact tumour progression, it remains unclear whether the deletion event, which frequently includes many genes, impacts tumorigenesis beyond TP53 loss alone. Here we show that somatic heterozygous deletion of mouse chromosome 11B3, a 4-megabase region syntenic to human 17p13.1, produces a greater effect on lymphoma and leukaemia development than Trp53 deletion. Mechanistically, the effect of 11B3 loss on tumorigenesis involves co-deleted genes such as Eif5a and Alox15b (also known as Alox8), the suppression of which cooperates with Trp53 loss to produce more aggressive disease. Our results imply that the selective advantage produced by human chromosome 17p deletion reflects the combined impact of TP53 loss and the reduced dosage of linked tumour suppressor genes.",

    "abstract": "The H3K9me3 repressive histone conformation of p53 target promoters is abrogated in response to p53 activation by MDM2-mediated SUV39H1 degradation. Here, we present evidence that the USP7 deubiquitinase protects SUV39H1 from MDM2-mediated ubiquitination in the absence of p53 stimulus. USP7 occupies p53 target promoters in unstressed conditions, a process that is abrogated with p53 activation associated with loss of the H3K9me3 mark on these same promoters. Mechanistically, USP7 forms a trimeric complex with MDM2 and SUV39H1, independent of DNA, and modulates MDM2-dependent SUV39H1 ubiquitination. Furthermore, we show that this protective function of USP7 on SUV39H1 is independent of p53. Finally, USP7 blocking cooperates with p53 in inducing apoptosis by enhancing p53 promoter occupancy and dependent transactivation of target genes. These results uncover a layer of the p53 transcriptional program mediated by USP7, which restrains relaxation of local chromatin conformation at p53 target promoters.",

This approach showed that B-NEG cases carry 10.5 mutations and 9.1 copy-number aberrations/sample. The most frequently mutated druggable pathways were those pertaining to RAS/RTK (26.8%) and JAK/STAT (12.5%) signaling. In particular, FLT3 and JAK/STAT mutations were detected mainly in AYA and adults, while KRAS and NRAS mutations were more frequent in children. RAS/RTK mutations negatively affected the outcome of AYA and adults, but not that of children. Furthermore, adult B-NEG ALL carrying JAK/STAT mutations had a shorter survival. In vitro experiments showed that FLT3 inhibitors reduced significantly the proliferation of FLT3-mutated primary B-NEG ALL cells. Likewise, PI3K/mTOR inhibitors reduced the proliferation of primary cells harboring RAS and IL7R mutations. These results refine the genetic landscape of B-NEG ALL and suggest that the different distribution of lesions and their prognostic impact might sustain the diverse outcome between children, adults and partly AYA - whose genomic scenario is similar to adults - and open the way to targeted therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Although p53-mediated cell cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis are well accepted as major tumor suppression mechanisms, the loss of these functions does not directly lead to tumorigenesis, suggesting that the precise roles of these canonical activities of p53 need to be redefined. Here, we report that the cells derived from the mutant mice expressing p533KR, an acetylation-defective mutant that fails to induce cell-cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis, exhibit high levels of aneuploidy upon DNA damage. Moreover, the embryonic lethality caused by the deficiency of XRCC4, a key DNA double strand break repair factor, can be fully rescued in the p533KR/3KR background. Notably, despite high levels of genomic instability, p533KR/3KRXRCC4-/- mice, unlike p53-/- XRCC4-/- mice, are not succumbed to pro-B-cell lymphomas. Nevertheless, p533KR/3KR XRCC4-/- mice display aging-like phenotypes including testicular atrophy, kyphosis, and premature death. Further analyses demonstrate that SLC7A11 is downregulated and that p53-mediated ferroptosis is significantly induced in spleens and testis of p533KR/3KRXRCC4-/- mice. These results demonstrate that the direct role of p53-mediated cell cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis is to control genomic stability in vivo. Our study not only validates the importance of ferroptosis in p53-mediated tumor suppression in vivo but also reveals that the combination of genomic instability and activation of ferroptosis may promote aging-associated phenotypes.",

Through biochemical analysis in Xenopus laevis egg extracts, we establish that the MRN (Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1) complex, CtIP, and BRCA1 are required for both the removal of Top2-DNA adducts and the subsequent resection of Top2-adducted DSB ends. Moreover, the interaction between CtIP and BRCA1, although dispensable for resection of endonuclease-generated DSB ends, is required for resection of Top2-adducted DSBs, as well as for cellular resistance to etoposide during genomic DNA replication.",

    "abstract": "Multiple chromosomal regions are affected by deletions in cervical cancer (CC) genomes, but their consequence and target gene involvement remains unknown. Our single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array identified 8p copy number losses localized to an 8.4 Mb minimal deleted region (MDR) in 36% of CC. The 8p MDR was associated with tumor size, treatment outcome, and with multiple HPV infections. Genetic, epigenetic, and expression analyses of candidate genes at MDR identified promoter hypermethylation and/or inactivation of decoy receptors TNFRSF10C and TNFRSF10D in the majority of CC patients. TNFRSF10C methylation was also detected in precancerous lesions suggesting that this change is an early event in cervical tumorigenesis. We further demonstrate here that CC cell lines exhibiting downregulated expression of TNFRSF10C and/or TNFRSF10D effectively respond to TRAIL-induced apoptosis and this affect was synergistic in combination with DNA damaging chemotherapeutic drugs. We show that the CC cell lines harboring epigenetic inactivation of TRAIL decoy receptors effectively activate downstream caspases suggesting a critical role of inactivation of these genes in efficient execution of extrinsic apoptotic pathway and therapy response. Therefore, these findings shed new light on the role of genetic/epigenetic defects in TRAIL decoy receptor genes in the pathogenesis of CC and provide an opportunity to explore strategies to test decoy receptor gene inactivation as a biomarker of response to Apo2L/TRAIL-combination therapy.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies indicate that p300 acts as a key transcriptional cofactor in vivo, at least, in part, by modulating activities of p53 by acetylation. Nevertheless, the regulation of the p53-p300 interplay is not completely understood. Here, we have identified the DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box RNA helicase 24 (DDX24) as a novel regulator of the p300-p53 axis. We found that DDX24 interacts with p300, and this interaction leads to suppression of p300-mediated acetylation of p53. Notably, RNA interference-mediated knockdown of endogenous DDX24 significantly increases the acetylation levels of endogenous p53 in human cancer cells and subsequently promotes p53-mediated activation of its transcriptional targets such as p21 and p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA). In contrast, DDX24 expression inhibits the p300-p53 interaction and suppresses p300-mediated acetylation of p53. Moreover, DDX24 is overexpressed in human cancer cells and reduction of DDX24 protein levels by RNA interference induces cell cycle arrest and senescence in a p53-dependent manner. These results reveal DDX24 as an important regulator of p300 and suggest that the modulation of the p53-p300 interplay by DDX24 is critical in controlling p53 activities in human cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms that maintain cancer stem cells are crucial to tumour progression. The ID2 protein supports cancer hallmarks including the cancer stem cell state. HIF\u03b1 transcription factors, most notably HIF2\u03b1 (also known as EPAS1), are expressed in and required for maintenance of cancer stem cells (CSCs). However, the pathways that are engaged by ID2 or drive HIF2\u03b1 accumulation in CSCs have remained unclear. Here we report that DYRK1A and DYRK1B kinases phosphorylate ID2 on threonine 27 (Thr27). Hypoxia downregulates this phosphorylation via inactivation of DYRK1A and DYRK1B. The activity of these kinases is stimulated in normoxia by the oxygen-sensing prolyl hydroxylase PHD1 (also known as EGLN2). ID2 binds to the VHL ubiquitin ligase complex, displaces VHL-associated Cullin 2, and impairs HIF2\u03b1 ubiquitylation and degradation. Phosphorylation of Thr27 of ID2 by DYRK1 blocks ID2-VHL interaction and preserves HIF2\u03b1 ubiquitylation. In glioblastoma, ID2 positively modulates HIF2\u03b1 activity. Conversely, elevated expression of DYRK1 phosphorylates Thr27 of ID2, leading to HIF2\u03b1 destabilization, loss of glioma stemness, inhibition of tumour growth, and a more favourable outcome for patients with glioblastoma.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitin modification at double strand breaks (DSB) sites is an essential regulator of signaling and repair. \u03b3H2AX extends from DSB sites and provides a platform for subsequent recruitment and amplification of DNA repair proteins and signaling factors. Here, we found that RNF8/RNF168 ubiquitylates \u03b3H2AX. We identified that USP11 is a unique deubiquitylation enzyme for \u03b3H2AX. USP11 deubiquitylates \u03b3H2AX both in vivo and in vitro but not the canonical (ub)-K119-H2A and (ub)-K120-H2B in vitro, and USP11 ablation enhances the levels of \u03b3H2AX ubiquitylation. We also found that USP11 interacts with \u03b3H2AX both in vivo and in vitro. We found that 53BP1 and ubiquitin-conjugated proteins are misregulated to be retained longer and stronger at DSB sites after knockdown of USP11. We further found that cells are hypersensitive to \u03b3-irradiation after ablation of USP11. Together, our findings elucidate deeply and extensively the mechanism of RNF8/RNF168 and USP11 to maintain the proper status of ubiquitylation \u03b3H2AX to repair DSB.",

    "abstract": "Osteoblasts, the bone forming cells, affect self-renewal and expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), as well as homing of healthy hematopoietic cells and tumor cells into the bone marrow. Constitutive activation of \u03b2-catenin in osteoblasts is sufficient to alter the differentiation potential of myeloid and lymphoid progenitors and to initiate the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in mice. We show here that Notch1 is the receptor mediating the leukemogenic properties of osteoblast-activated \u03b2-catenin in HSCs. Moreover, using cell-specific gene inactivation mouse models, we show that FoxO1 expression in osteoblasts is required for and mediates the leukemogenic properties of \u03b2-catenin. At the molecular level, FoxO1 interacts with \u03b2-catenin in osteoblasts to induce expression of the Notch ligand, Jagged-1. Subsequent activation of Notch signaling in long-term repopulating HSC progenitors induces the leukemogenic transformation of HSCs and ultimately leads to the development of AML. These findings identify FoxO1 expressed in osteoblasts as a factor affecting hematopoiesis and provide a molecular mechanism whereby the FoxO1/activated \u03b2-catenin interaction results in AML. These observations support the notion that the bone marrow niche is an instigator of leukemia and raise the prospect that FoxO1 oncogenic properties may occur in other tissues.",

In this study we show that FOXO1 transcription factor expression was restricted to the GC DZ and was required for DZ formation, since its absence in mice led to the loss of DZ gene programs and the formation of LZ-only GCs. FOXO1-negative GC B cells displayed normal somatic hypermutation but defective affinity maturation and class switch recombination. The function of FOXO1 in sustaining the DZ program involved the trans-activation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4, and cooperation with the BCL6 transcription factor in the trans-repression of genes involved in immune activation, DNA repair, and plasma cell differentiation. These results also have implications for the role of FOXO1 in lymphomagenesis because they suggest that constitutive FOXO1 activity might be required for the oncogenic activity of deregulated BCL6 expression.",

Mutation analysis identified a broad spectrum of somatic mutations in key genes involved in epigenetic regulation (TET2, CREBBP, KMT2D (MLL2), KMT2C (MLL3), BRD9, SMARCA4 and CHD3) and signaling, including MAPK1, BRAF, CARD11 and PRKG1 mutations driving increased MAPK, NF-\u03baB and NFAT activity upon T cell receptor stimulation.

Ablation of FOXO1 in AgRP neurons of mice results in reduced food intake, leanness, improved glucose homeostasis, and increased sensitivity to insulin and leptin. We tentatively identified G-protein-coupled receptor Gpr17 as an effector of FOXO1 orexigenic signals in AgRP neurons. In this study, we generated and characterized AgRP neuron-specific Gpr17 knockout mice (Agrp-Gpr17(-/-)) to test the hypothesis that Gpr17 regulates appetite, energy expenditure, and metabolism. Agrp-Gpr17(-/-) mice show reduced food intake, increased relative energy expenditure, and increased satiety, resulting in leanness and reduced body fat. They also show increased central nervous system sensitivity to insulin and leptin and reduced plasma glucose excursions following the administration of glucose or pyruvate. In summary, AgRP neuron-specific Gpr17 knockouts phenocopy FOXO1 knockouts in the same cell type, thus supporting our original hypothesis and providing further impetus to develop Gpr17 antagonists for the treatment of obesity.",

We report the characterization of the phages A-HIS1 and A-HIS2, capable of infecting Acaryochloris. Morphological characterization of these phages places them in the family Siphoviridae. However, molecular characterization reveals that they do not show genetic similarity with any known siphoviruses. While the phages do show synteny between each other, the nucleotide identity between the phages is low at 45-67%, suggesting they diverged from each other some time ago. The greatest number of genes shared with another phage (a myovirus infecting marine Synechococcus) was four. Unlike most other cyanophages and in common with the Siphoviridae infecting Synechococcus, no photosynthesis-related genes were found in the genome. CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) spacers from the host Acaryochloris had partial matches to sequences found within the phages, which is the first time CRISPRs have been reported in a cyanobacterial/cyanophage system. The phages also encode a homologue of the proteobacterial RNase T. The potential function of RNase T in the mark-up or digestion of crRNA hints at a novel mechanism for evading the host CRISPR system.",

We extend the number of CLL driver alterations, including changes in ZNF292, ZMYM3, ARID1A and PTPN11. We also identify novel recurrent mutations in non-coding regions, including the 3' region of NOTCH1, which cause aberrant splicing events, increase NOTCH1 activity and result in a more aggressive disease. In addition, mutations in an enhancer located on chromosome 9p13 result in reduced expression of the B-cell-specific transcription factor PAX5. The accumulative number of driver alterations (0 to \u22654) discriminated between patients with differences in clinical behaviour. This study provides an integrated portrait of the CLL genomic landscape, identifies new recurrent driver mutations of the disease, and suggests clinical interventions that may improve the management of this neoplasia.",

    "abstract": "Current understanding infers a neural crest origin of thyroid C cells, the major source of calcitonin in mammals and ancestors to neuroendocrine thyroid tumors. The concept is primarily based on investigations in quail-chick chimeras involving fate mapping of neural crest cells to the ultimobranchial glands that regulate Ca(2+) homeostasis in birds, reptiles, amphibians and fishes, but whether mammalian C cell development involves a homologous ontogenetic trajectory has not been experimentally verified. With lineage tracing, we now provide direct evidence that Sox17+ anterior endoderm is the only source of differentiated C cells and their progenitors in mice. Like many gut endoderm derivatives, embryonic C cells were found to coexpress pioneer factors forkhead box (Fox) a1 and Foxa2 before neuroendocrine differentiation takes place. In the ultimobranchial body epithelium emerging from pharyngeal pouch endoderm in early organogenesis, differential Foxa1/Foxa2 expression distinguished two spatially separated pools of C cell precursors with different growth properties. A similar expression pattern was recapitulated in medullary thyroid carcinoma cells in vivo, consistent with a growth-promoting role of Foxa1. In contrast to embryonic precursor cells, C cell-derived tumor cells invading the stromal compartment downregulated Foxa2, foregoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition designated by loss of E-cadherin; both Foxa2 and E-cadherin were re-expressed at metastatic sites. These findings revise mammalian C cell ontogeny, expand the neuroendocrine repertoire of endoderm and redefine the boundaries of neural crest diversification. The data further underpin distinct functions of Foxa1 and Foxa2 in both embryonic and tumor development.",

    "abstract": "Activating mutations in NOTCH1 are common in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Here we identify glutaminolysis as a critical pathway for leukemia cell growth downstream of NOTCH1 and a key determinant of the response to anti-NOTCH1 therapies in vivo. Mechanistically, inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling in T-ALL induces a metabolic shutdown, with prominent inhibition of glutaminolysis and triggers autophagy as a salvage pathway supporting leukemia cell metabolism. Consequently, inhibition of glutaminolysis and inhibition of autophagy strongly and synergistically enhance the antileukemic effects of anti-NOTCH1 therapy in mice harboring T-ALL. Moreover, we demonstrate that Pten loss upregulates glycolysis and consequently rescues leukemic cell metabolism, thereby abrogating the antileukemic effects of NOTCH1 inhibition. Overall, these results identify glutaminolysis as a major node in cancer metabolism controlled by NOTCH1 and as therapeutic target for the treatment of T-ALL.",

    "title": "Disruption of KMT2D perturbs germinal center B cell development and promotes lymphomagenesis",
    "abstract": "Mutations in the gene encoding the KMT2D (or MLL2) methyltransferase are highly recurrent and occur early during tumorigenesis in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). However, the functional consequences of these mutations and their role in lymphomagenesis are unknown. Here we show that FL- and DLBCL-associated KMT2D mutations impair KMT2D enzymatic activity, leading to diminished global H3K4 methylation in germinal-center (GC) B cells and DLBCL cells. Conditional deletion of Kmt2d early during B cell development, but not after initiation of the GC reaction, results in an increase in GC B cells and enhances B cell proliferation in mice. Moreover, genetic ablation of Kmt2d in mice overexpressing Bcl2 increases the incidence of GC-derived lymphomas resembling human tumors. These findings suggest that KMT2D acts as a tumor suppressor gene whose early loss facilitates lymphomagenesis by remodeling the epigenetic landscape of the cancer precursor cells. Eradication of KMT2D-deficient cells may thus represent a rational therapeutic approach for targeting early tumorigenic events.",

Molecular studies are enhancing our understanding of the pathogenesis of T-ALL, and the discovery of activating mutations of NOTCH1 and FBXW7 in a majority of patients has been a seminal observation. The use of pediatric intensive combination chemotherapy regimens in adolescents and young adults has significantly improved the outcome of patients with T-ALL. The use of nelarabine for relapsed and refractory T-ALL results in responses in a substantial minority of patients. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) still plays a key role in patients with high-risk or relapsed/refractory disease. \u03b3-Secretase inhibitors hold promise for the treatment of patients with NOTCH1 mutations, and the results of clinical trials with these agents are eagerly awaited. It is recommended that younger patients receive a pediatric-intensive regimen. Older and unfit patients can receive suitable multiagent chemotherapy and be allocated to HCT based on their response, risk factors, and comorbidities. Although advances in the treatment of T-ALL have lagged behind those of B-cell ALL, it is hoped that the molecular revolution will enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of this aggressive lymphoid malignancy.",

By combining genome-wide RNAi screens with regulatory network analysis, we identified STAT3 as a critically activated master regulator of HR(-)/HER2(+) tumors, eliciting tumor dependency in these cells. Mechanistically, HR(-)/HER2(+) cells secrete high levels of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) cytokine, inducing the activation of STAT3, which in turn promotes a second autocrine stimulus to increase S100A8/9 complex (calprotectin) production and secretion. Increased calprotectin levels activate signaling pathways involved in proliferation and resistance. Importantly, we demonstrated that inhibition of the IL-6-Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-STAT3-calprotectin axis with FDA-approved drugs, alone and in combination with HER2 inhibitors, reduced the tumorigenicity of HR(-)/HER2(+) breast cancers, opening novel targeted therapeutic opportunities.",

Accordingly, suppression of DNA-PKcs inhibits tumor metastases. Clinical assessment revealed that DNA-PKcs is significantly elevated in advanced disease and independently predicts for metastases, recurrence, and reduced overall survival. Further investigation demonstrated that DNA-PKcs in advanced tumors is highly activated, independent of DNA damage indicators.

    "abstract": "Obesity is associated with higher incidence of cancer, but the predisposing mechanisms remain poorly understood. The NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase SirT1 orchestrates metabolism, cellular survival, and growth. However, there is no unifying mechanism to explain the metabolic and tumor-related effects of SirT1. In this work, we demonstrate that genetic ablation of the endogenous inhibitor of SirT1, Deleted-in-Breast-Cancer-1 (Dbc1), unexpectedly results in obesity and insulin resistance. Dbc1 deficiency promoted SirT1-dependent gain of function of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (Scd1), increasing plasma and tissue levels of unsaturated fatty acids. The metabolic abnormalities in Dbc1(-/-) mice were reversed by ablation of hepatic SirT1 or by inhibition of Scd1 activity. Furthermore, loss of Dbc1 impaired activation of the master tumor suppressor p53 and treatment with an Scd1 inhibitor extended survival of tumor-prone TP53(-/-) mice by decreasing tumor-related death. Together, our findings illustrate a shared mechanism of obesity and tumor progression mediated by hepatic SirT1 and resulting in the activation of a key lipid synthetic enzyme, with potential therapeutic implications.",

Here we demonstrate that T-ALL cells are in direct, stable contact with CXCL12-producing bone marrow stroma. Cxcl12 deletion from vascular endothelial, but not perivascular, cells impeded tumor growth, suggesting a vascular niche for T-ALL. Moreover, genetic targeting of Cxcr4 in murine T-ALL after disease onset led to rapid, sustained disease remission, and CXCR4 antagonism suppressed human T-ALL in primary xenografts. Loss of CXCR4 targeted key T-ALL regulators, including the MYC pathway, and decreased leukemia initiating cell activity in vivo.

    "abstract": "Tumors are the result of accumulated genomic alterations that cooperate synergistically to produce uncontrollable cell growth. Although identifying recurrent alterations among large collections of tumors provides a way to pinpoint genes that endow a selective advantage in oncogenesis and progression, it fails to address the genetic interactions behind this selection process. A non-random pattern of co-mutated genes is evidence for selective forces acting on tumor cells that harbor combinations of these genetic alterations. Although existing methods have successfully identified mutually exclusive gene sets, no current method can systematically discover more general genetic relationships. We develop Genomic Alteration Modules using Total Correlation (GAMToC), an information theoretic framework that integrates copy number and mutation data to identify gene modules with any non-random pattern of joint alteration. Additionally, we present the Seed-GAMToC procedure, which uncovers the mutational context of any putative cancer gene. The software is publicly available. Applied to glioblastoma multiforme samples, GAMToC results show distinct subsets of co-occurring mutations, suggesting distinct mutational routes to cancer and providing new insight into mutations associated with proneural, proneural/G-CIMP, and classical types of the disease. The results recapitulate known relationships such as mutual exclusive mutations, place these alterations in the context of other mutations, and find more complex relationships such as conditional mutual exclusivity.",

    "abstract": "Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase is a master regulator of the DNA damage response. ATM is frequently inactivated in human B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including ~50% of mantle cell lymphomas (MCLs) characterized by ectopic expression of CyclinD1. Here we report that early and robust deletion of ATM in precursor/progenitor B cells causes cell autonomous, clonal mature B-cell lymphomas of both pre- and post-germinal center (GC) origins. Unexpectedly, naive B-cell-specific deletion of ATM is not sufficient to induce lymphomas in mice, highlighting the important tumor suppressor function of ATM in immature B cells. Although E\u03bcCyclinD1 is not sufficient to induce lymphomas, E\u03bcCyclinD1 accelerates the kinetics and increases the incidence of clonal lymphomas in ATM-deficient B-cells and skews the lymphomas toward pre-GC-derived small lymphocytic neoplasms, sharing morphological features of human MCL. This is in part due to CyclinD1-driven expansion of ATM-deficient naive B cells with genomic instability, which promotes the deletions of additional tumor suppressor genes (i.e. Trp53, Mll2, Rb1 and Cdkn2a). Together these findings define a synergistic function of ATM and CyclinD1 in pre-GC B-cell proliferation and lymphomagenesis and provide a prototypic animal model to study the pathogenesis of human MCL.",

    "abstract": "Relapse is the leading cause of mortality in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Among chemotherapeutics, thiopurines are key drugs in ALL combination therapy. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified relapse-specific mutations in the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1 gene (PRPS1), which encodes a rate-limiting purine biosynthesis enzyme, in 24/358 (6.7%) relapsed childhood B cell ALL (B-ALL) cases. All individuals who harbored PRPS1 mutations relapsed early during treatment, and mutated ALL clones expanded exponentially before clinical relapse. Our functional analyses of PRPS1 mutants uncovered a new chemotherapy-resistance mechanism involving reduced feedback inhibition of de novo purine biosynthesis and competitive inhibition of thiopurine activation. Notably, the de novo purine synthesis inhibitor lometrexol effectively abrogated PRPS1 mutant-driven drug resistance. These results highlight the importance of constitutive activation of the de novo purine synthesis pathway in thiopurine resistance, and they offer therapeutic strategies for the treatment of relapsed and thiopurine-resistant ALL.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin conformation has a major role in all cellular decisions. We showed previously that P53 pro-apoptotic target promoters are enriched with H3K9me3 mark and induction of P53 abrogates this repressive chromatin conformation by downregulating SUV39H1, the writer of this mark present on these promoters. In the present study, we demonstrate that in response to P53 stabilization, its pro-apoptotic target promoters become enriched with the H3K4me3 epigenetic mark as well as its readers, Wdr5, RbBP5 and Ash2L, which were not observed in response to SUV39H1 downregulation alone. Overexpression of Ash2L enhanced P53-dependent apoptosis in response to chemotherapy, associated with increased P53 pro-apoptotic gene promoter occupancy and target gene expression. In contrast, pre-silencing of Ash2L abrogated P53's ability to induce the expression of these transcriptional targets, without affecting P53 or RNAP II recruitment. However, Ash2L pre-silencing, under the same conditions, resulted in reduced RNAP II ser5-CTD phosphorylation on these same pro-apoptotic target promoters, which correlated with reduced promoter occupancy of TFIIB as well as TFIIF (RAP74). Based on these findings, we propose that Ash2L acts in concert with P53 promoter occupancy to activate RNAP II by aiding formation of a stable transcription pre-initiation complex required for its activation.",

Possibly because of the prevalence of genetic alterations activating canonical NF-\u03baB activity, a role for oncogenic lesions that activate the alternative NF-\u03baB pathway in DLBCL has remained elusive. Here, we show that deletion/mutation of TRAF3, a negative regulator of the alternative NF-\u03baB pathway, occurs in \u223c15% of DLBCLs and that it often coexists with BCL6 translocation, which prevents terminal B cell differentiation. Accordingly, in a mouse model constitutive activation of the alternative NF-\u03baB pathway cooperates with BCL6 deregulation in DLBCL development. This work demonstrates a key oncogenic role for the alternative NF-\u03baB pathway in DLBCL development.",

Here we identify Hairy and Enhancer of Split 1 (HES1), a transcriptional repressor controlled by NOTCH1, as a critical mediator of NOTCH1-induced leukemogenesis strictly required for tumor cell survival. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that HES1 directly downregulates the expression of BBC3, the gene encoding the PUMA BH3-only proapoptotic factor in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Finally, we identify perhexiline, a small-molecule inhibitor of mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, as a HES1-signature antagonist drug with robust antileukemic activity against NOTCH1-induced leukemias in vitro and in vivo.",

However, it is unclear whether and how the host immune response can regulate the microbiota to mediate colonization resistance. ID2, an essential transcriptional regulator for the development of innate lymphoid cell (ILC) progenitors, remains highly expressed in differentiated ILCs with unknown function. Using conditionally deficient mice in which ID2 is deleted from differentiated ILC3s, we observed that these mutant mice exhibited greatly impaired gut colonization resistance against Citrobacter rodentium. Utilizing gnotobiotic hosts, we showed that the ID2-dependent early colonization resistance was mediated by interleukin-22 (IL-22) regulation of the microbiota. In addition to regulating development, ID2 maintained homeostasis of ILC3s and controlled IL-22 production through an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and IL-23 receptor pathway. Thus, ILC3s can mediate immune surveillance, which constantly maintains a proper microbiota, to facilitate early colonization resistance through an ID2-dependent regulation of IL-22.",

    "title": "Differential phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs regulates the interplay between end-processing and end-ligation during nonhomologous end-joining",
    "abstract": "Nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) is a major DNA double-strand break repair pathway that is conserved in eukaryotes. In vertebrates, NHEJ further acquires end-processing capacities (e.g., hairpin opening) in addition to direct end-ligation. The catalytic subunit of DNA-PK (DNA-PKcs) is a vertebrate-specific NHEJ factor that can be autophosphorylated or transphosphorylated by ATM kinase. Using a mouse model expressing a kinase-dead (KD) DNA-PKcs protein, we show that ATM-mediated transphosphorylation of DNA-PKcs regulates end-processing at the level of Artemis recruitment, while strict autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs is necessary to relieve the physical blockage on end-ligation imposed by the DNA-PKcs protein itself. Accordingly, DNA-PKcs(KD/KD) mice and cells show severe end-ligation defects and p53- and Ku-dependent embryonic lethality, but open hairpin-sealed ends normally in the presence of ATM kinase activity. Together, our findings identify DNA-PKcs as the molecular switch that coordinates end-processing and end-ligation at the DNA ends through differential phosphorylations.",

    "abstract": "Although p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis serve as critical barriers to cancer development, emerging evidence suggests that the metabolic activities of p53 are also important. Here we show that p53 inhibits cystine uptake and sensitizes cells to ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death, by repressing expression of SLC7A11, a key component of the cystine/glutamate antiporter. Notably, p53(3KR), an acetylation-defective mutant that fails to induce cell-cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis, fully retains the ability to regulate SLC7A11 expression and induce ferroptosis upon reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced stress. Analysis of mutant mice shows that these non-canonical p53 activities contribute to embryonic development and the lethality associated with loss of Mdm2. Moreover, SLC7A11 is highly expressed in human tumours, and its overexpression inhibits ROS-induced ferroptosis and abrogates p53(3KR)-mediated tumour growth suppression in xenograft models. Our findings uncover a new mode of tumour suppression based on p53 regulation of cystine metabolism, ROS responses and ferroptosis.",

Over the past decade, the rapid expansion of sequencing technologies allowing the genome-wide assessment of genomic and transcriptional changes has revolutionized our understanding of the genetic basis of DLBCL by providing a comprehensive and unbiased view of the genes/pathways that are disrupted by genetic alterations in this disease, and may contribute to tumor initiation and expansion. These studies uncovered the existence of several previously unappreciated alterations in key cellular pathways that may also influence treatment outcome. Indeed, a number of newly identified genetic lesions are currently being explored as markers for improved diagnosis and risk stratification, or are entering clinical trials as promising therapeutic targets. This review focuses on recent advances in the genomic characterization of DLBCL and discusses how information gained from these efforts has provided new insights into its biology, uncovering potential targets of prognostic and therapeutic relevance.",

    "abstract": "MYC deregulation is a driver of many human cancers. Altering the balance of MYC protein levels at the level of transcription, protein stability, or turnover is sufficient to transform cells to a tumorigenic phenotype. While direct targeting of MYC is difficult, specific genetic vulnerabilities of MYC-deregulated cells could be exploited to selectively inhibit their growth. Using a genome-wide shRNA screen, we identified 78 candidate genes, which are required for survival of human mammary epithelial cells with elevated MYC levels. Among the candidates, we validated and characterized FBXW7, a component of the SCF-like ubiquitin ligase complex that targets MYC for proteasomal degradation. Down-regulation of FBXW7 leads to synergistic accumulation of cellular and active chromatin-bound MYC, while protein levels of other FBXW7 targets appear unaffected. Over a four-week time course, continuous FBXW7 down-regulation and MYC activation together cause an accumulation of cells in S-phase and G2/M-phase of the cell cycle. Under these conditions, we also observe elevated chromatin-bound levels of CDC45, suggesting increased DNA replication stress. Consistent with these results, FBXW7 down-regulation alone decreases the survival of T47D breast cancer cells. These results establish that FBXW7 down-regulation is synthetic lethal with MYC, and that MYC is a critical target of FBXW7 in breast epithelial cells.",

However, it is unclear how NHEJ factors organize to repair diverse types of DNA breaks. Here, through systematic analysis of the human NHEJ factor interactome, we identify PAXX as a direct interactor of Ku. The crystal structure of PAXX is similar to those of XRCC4 and XLF. Importantly, PAXX-deficient cells are sensitive to DSB-causing agents. Moreover, epistasis analysis demonstrates that PAXX functions together with XLF in response to ionizing radiation-induced complex DSBs, whereas they function redundantly in response to Topo2 inhibitor-induced simple DSBs. Consistently, PAXX and XLF coordinately promote the ligation of complex but not simple DNA ends in vitro. Altogether, our data identify PAXX as a new NHEJ factor and provide insight regarding the organization of NHEJ factors responding to diverse types of DSB ends.",

Although a lot is known about hematopoiesis, molecular mechanisms that control HSC quiescence remain largely unknown. The ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20 functions as a central regulator of inflammation and adaptive immunity. Here, we show that a deficiency of A20 in the hematopoietic system causes anemia, lymphopenia, and postnatal lethality. Lack of A20 in HSCs results in diminished pool size, impaired radioprotection, defective repopulation, and loss of quiescence. A20-deficient HSCs display increased IFN-\u03b3 signaling, caused by augmented NF-\u03baB activation. Strikingly, deletion of both IFN-\u03b3 and A20 in hematopoietic cells results in partial rescue of the HSC phenotype. We anticipate that our experiments will facilitate the understanding of mechanisms through which A20-mediated inflammatory signals control HSC quiescence and functions.",

Advances in nanotechnology have allowed the origins of wear processes to be studied at the atomic and molecular scale, but also demand that wear in nanoscale systems can be predicted and controlled. Biomolecular systems can undergo a range of active movements at the nanoscale, which are enabled by the transduction of chemical energy into mechanical work by polymerization processes and motor proteins. The active movements are accompanied by dissipative processes that can be conceptually understood as 'protein friction'. Here, we show that wear also occurs in an in vitro system consisting of microtubules gliding across a surface coated with kinesin-1 motor proteins, and that energetic considerations suggest a molecule-by-molecule removal of tubulin proteins. The rates of removal show a complex dependence on sliding velocity and kinesin density, which, in contrast to the friction behaviour between microtubules and kinesin-8, cannot be explained by simple chemical reaction kinetics.",

    "abstract": "The p53 tumor suppressor is a multifaceted polypeptide that impedes tumorigenesis by regulating a diverse array of cellular processes. Triggered by a wide variety of stress stimuli, p53 transcriptionally regulates genes involved in the canonical tumor suppression pathways of apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, and senescence. We recently discovered a novel mechanism whereby p53 inhibits cystine uptake through repression of the SLC7A11 gene to mediate ferroptosis. Importantly, this p53-SLC7A11 axis is preserved in the p53(3KR) mutant, and contributes to its ability to suppress tumorigenesis in the absence of the classical tumor suppression mechanisms. Here, we report that wild type p53 can induce both apoptosis and ferroptosis upon reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced stress. Furthermore, we demonstrate that p53's functional N-terminal domain is required for its capacity to regulate oxidative stress responses and ferroptosis. Notably, activated p53 dynamically modulates intracellular ROS, causing an initial reduction and a subsequent increase of ROS levels. Taken together, these data implicate ferroptosis as an additional component of the cell death program induced by wild type p53 in human cancer cells, and reveal a complex and dynamic role of p53 in oxidative stress responses.",

    "abstract": "Cell cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis are commonly regarded as the major tumor suppression mechanisms of p53. However, accumulating evidence indicates that loss of these canonical functions is not sufficient for tumor formation, highlighting the complexity of p53-mediated tumor suppression. PCDH10 belongs to a proto cadherin protein family and is a potential tumor suppressor protein as the dysregulation of PCDH10 gene frequently existed in multiple human tumors. Here, we found that PCDH10 is a transcriptional target of p53 and that the levels of PCDH10 expression can be induced by wild type p53 but not mutant p53 in a number of human cancer cell lines. Moreover, we identified a p53 consensus binding site located in the PCDH10 promoter region that is responsive to p53 regulation. Although upregulation of PCDH10 has no obvious effect on growth arrest or apoptosis in human cells, PCDH10 exhibits inhibitory roles in cancer cell motility and cell migration. These results suggest an important role of p53 in regulating tumor cell migration through activating PCDH10 expression and support the notion that non-canonical activities of p53 may contribute to its tumor suppressor function in vivo.",

These precursors must be protected from DNA damage-induced cell death, however, because V(D)J recombination generates double-strand breaks and may activate p53. Here we show that the BTB/POZ domain protein Miz-1 restricts p53-dependent induction of apoptosis in both pro-B and DN3a pre-T cells that actively rearrange antigen receptor genes. Miz-1 exerts this function by directly activating the gene for ribosomal protein L22 (Rpl22), which binds to p53 mRNA and negatively regulates its translation. This mechanism limits p53 expression levels and thus contains its apoptosis-inducing functions in lymphocytes, precisely at differentiation stages in which V(D)J recombination occurs.",

    "title": "DNA hydroxymethylation profiling reveals that WT1 mutations result in loss of TET2 function in acute myeloid leukemia",
    "abstract": "Somatic mutations in IDH1/IDH2 and TET2 result in impaired TET2-mediated conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). The observation that WT1 inactivating mutations anticorrelate with TET2/IDH1/IDH2 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) led us to hypothesize that WT1 mutations may impact TET2 function. WT1 mutant AML patients have reduced 5hmC levels similar to TET2/IDH1/IDH2 mutant AML. These mutations are characterized by convergent, site-specific alterations in DNA hydroxymethylation, which drive differential gene expression more than alterations in\u00a0DNA promoter methylation. WT1 overexpression increases global levels of 5hmC, and WT1 silencing reduced 5hmC levels. WT1 physically interacts with TET2 and TET3, and WT1 loss of function results in a similar hematopoietic differentiation phenotype as observed with TET2 deficiency. These data provide a role for WT1 in regulating DNA hydroxymethylation and suggest that TET2 IDH1/IDH2 and WT1 mutations define an AML subtype defined by dysregulated DNA hydroxymethylation.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is a clonal evolutionary process, caused by successive accumulation of genetic alterations providing milestones of tumor initiation, progression, dissemination, and/or resistance to certain therapeutic regimes. To unravel these milestones we propose a framework, tumor evolutionary directed graphs (TEDG), which is able to characterize the history of genetic alterations by integrating longitudinal and cross-sectional genomic data. We applied TEDG to a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cohort of 70 patients spanning 12 years and show that: (a) the evolution of CLL follows a time-ordered process represented as a global flow in TEDG that proceeds from initiating events to late events; (b) there are two distinct and mutually exclusive evolutionary paths of CLL evolution; (c) higher fitness clones are present in later stages of the disease, indicating a progressive clonal replacement with more aggressive clones. Our results suggest that TEDG may constitute an effective framework to recapitulate the evolutionary history of tumors.",

    "abstract": "The key member of the MOZ (monocyticleukaemia zinc finger protein), Ybf2/Sas3, Sas2, and TIP60 acetyltransferases family, Tat-interactive protein, 60 kD (TIP60), tightly modulates a wide array of cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling, gene transcription, apoptosis, DNA repair, and cell cycle arrest. The function of TIP60 can be regulated by SIRT1 through deacetylation. Here we found that TIP60 can also be functionally regulated by HDAC3. We identified six lysine residues as its autoacetylation sites. Mutagenesis of these lysines to arginines completely abolishes the autoacetylation of TIP60. Overexpression of HDAC3 increases TIP60 ubiquitination levels. However, unlike SIRT1, HDAC3 increased the half-life of TIP60. Further study found that HDAC3 colocalized with TIP60 both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, which could be the reason why HDAC3 can stabilize TIP60. The deacetylation of TIP60 by both SIRT1 and HDAC3 reduces apoptosis induced by DNA damage. Knockdown of HDAC3 in cells increased TIP60 acetylation levels and increased apoptosis after DNA damage. Together, our findings provide a better understanding of TIP60 regulation mechanisms, which is a significant basis for further studies of its cellular functions.",

    "abstract": "Recently, we demonstrated that the microRNA 424(322)/503 [miR-424(322)/503] cluster is transcriptionally controlled by transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) in the mammary epithelium. Induction of this microRNA cluster impacts mammary epithelium fate by regulating apoptosis and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling. Here, we expanded our finding to demonstrate that miR-424(322)/503 is an integral component of the cell cycle arrest mediated by TGF-\u03b2. Mechanistically, we showed that after TGF-\u03b2 exposure, increased levels of miR-424(322)/503 reduce the expression of the cell cycle regulator CDC25A. miR-424(322)/503-dependent posttranscriptional downregulation of CDC25A cooperates with previously described transcriptional repression of the CDC25A promoter and proteasome-mediated degradation to reduce the levels of CDC25A expression and to induce cell cycle arrest. We also provide evidence that the TGF-\u03b2/miR-424(322)/503 axis is part of the mechanism that regulates the proliferation of hormone receptor-positive (HR(+)) mammary epithelial cells in vivo.",

    "abstract": "T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) is a haematological malignancy with a dismal overall prognosis, including a relapse rate of up to 25%, mainly because of the lack of non-cytotoxic targeted therapy options. Drugs that target the function of key epigenetic factors have been approved in the context of haematopoietic disorders, and mutations that affect chromatin modulators in a variety of leukaemias have recently been identified; however, 'epigenetic' drugs are not currently used for T-ALL treatment. Recently, we described that the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) has a tumour-suppressor role in T-ALL. Here we delineated the role of the histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylases JMJD3 and UTX in T-ALL. We show that JMJD3 is essential for the initiation and maintenance of T-ALL, as it controls important oncogenic gene targets by modulating H3K27 methylation. By contrast, we found that UTX functions as a tumour suppressor and is frequently genetically inactivated in T-ALL. Moreover, we demonstrated that the small molecule inhibitor GSKJ4 (ref. 5) affects T-ALL growth, by targeting JMJD3 activity. These findings show that two proteins with a similar enzymatic function can have opposing roles in the context of the same disease, paving the way for treating haematopoietic malignancies with a new category of epigenetic inhibitors.",

Here, we identify the interaction between the NF-\u03baB-regulated antiapoptotic factor GADD45\u03b2 and the JNK kinase MKK7 as a therapeutic target in MM. Using a drug-discovery strategy, we developed DTP3, a D-tripeptide, which disrupts the GADD45\u03b2/MKK7 complex, kills MM cells effectively, and, importantly, lacks toxicity to normal cells. DTP3 has similar anticancer potency to the clinical standard, bortezomib, but more than 100-fold higher cancer cell specificity in\u00a0vitro. Notably, DTP3 ablates myeloma xenografts in mice with no apparent side effects at the effective doses. Hence, cancer-selective targeting of the NF-\u03baB pathway is possible and, at least for myeloma patients, promises a profound benefit.",

We propose a framework for the systematic discovery of genetic alterations that are causal determinants of disease, by prioritizing genes upstream of functional disease drivers, within regulatory networks inferred de novo from experimental data. We tested this framework by identifying the genetic determinants of the mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma. Our analysis uncovered KLHL9 deletions as upstream activators of two previously established master regulators of the subtype, C/EBP\u03b2 and C/EBP\u03b4. Rescue of KLHL9 expression induced proteasomal degradation of C/EBP proteins, abrogated the mesenchymal signature, and reduced tumor viability in vitro and in vivo. Deletions of KLHL9 were confirmed in > 50% of mesenchymal cases in an independent cohort, thus representing the most frequent genetic determinant of the subtype. The method generalized to study other human diseases, including breast cancer and Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Efforts to identify and annotate cancer driver genetic lesions have been focused primarily on the analysis of protein-coding genes; however, most genetic abnormalities found in human cancer are located in intergenic regions. Here we identify a new long range-acting MYC enhancer controlled by NOTCH1 that is targeted by recurrent chromosomal duplications in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). This highly conserved regulatory element, hereby named N-Me for NOTCH MYC enhancer, is located within a broad super-enhancer region +1.47 Mb from the MYC transcription initiating site, interacts with the MYC proximal promoter and induces orientation-independent MYC expression in reporter assays. Moreover, analysis of N-Me knockout mice demonstrates a selective and essential role of this regulatory element during thymocyte development and in NOTCH1-induced T-ALL. Together these results identify N-Me as a long-range oncogenic enhancer implicated directly in the pathogenesis of human leukemia and highlight the importance of the NOTCH1-MYC regulatory axis in T cell transformation and as a therapeutic target in T-ALL.",

Here, we report that XLF-deficient mice recapitulate the age-dependent lymphocytopenia of patients. We show that XLF deficiency leads to premature aging of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), measured by decreased functional capacity in transplantation assays, preferential myeloid reconstitution, and reduced self-renewal at a young age. We propose that premature aging of HSCs, together with previously reported defects in class-switch recombination and memory immune response, underlies the progressive and severe lymphocytopenia in XLF-deficient patients in the absence of measurable V(D)J recombination defects.",

RNA sequencing offers a genome-wide view of expressed transcripts, uncovering biologically functional gene fusions. Although several bioinformatics tools are already available for the detection of putative fusion transcripts, candidate event lists are plagued with non-functional read-through events, reverse transcriptase template switching events, incorrect mapping, and other systematic errors. Such lists lack any indication of oncogenic relevance, and they are too large for exhaustive experimental validation.",

    "abstract": "Notch signaling is a key developmental pathway that is subject to frequent genetic and epigenetic perturbations in many different human tumors. Here we investigate whether long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) genes, in addition to mRNAs, are key downstream targets of oncogenic Notch1 in human T\u00a0cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). By integrating transcriptome profiles with chromatin state maps, we have uncovered many previously unreported T-ALL-specific lncRNA genes, a fraction of which are directly controlled by the Notch1/Rpbj\u03ba activator complex. Finally we have shown that one specific Notch-regulated lncRNA, LUNAR1, is required for efficient T-ALL growth in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo due to its ability to enhance IGF1R mRNA expression and sustain IGF1 signaling. These results confirm that lncRNAs are important downstream targets of the Notch signaling pathway, and additionally they are key regulators of the oncogenic state in T-ALL.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic cells (DCs) comprise two major subsets, the interferon (IFN)-producing plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and antigen-presenting classical DCs (cDCs). The development of pDCs is promoted by E protein transcription factor E2-2, whereas E protein antagonist Id2 is specifically absent from pDCs. Conversely, Id2 is prominently expressed in cDCs and promotes CD8(+) cDC development. The mechanisms that control the balance between E and Id proteins during DC subset specification remain unknown. We found that the loss of Mtg16, a transcriptional cofactor of the ETO protein family, profoundly impaired pDC development and pDC-dependent IFN response. The residual Mtg16-deficient pDCs showed aberrant phenotype, including the expression of myeloid marker CD11b. Conversely, the development of cDC progenitors (pre-DCs) and of CD8(+) cDCs was enhanced. Genome-wide expression and DNA-binding analysis identified Id2 as a direct target of Mtg16. Mtg16-deficient cDC progenitors and pDCs showed aberrant induction of Id2, and the deletion of Id2 facilitated the impaired development of Mtg16-deficient pDCs. Thus, Mtg16 promotes pDC differentiation and restricts cDC development in part by repressing Id2, revealing a cell-intrinsic mechanism that controls subset balance during DC development.",

Thus, genetic lesions, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, that disrupt DSB repair are often associated with cancer susceptibility. In addition, recent evidence suggests that DSB \"mis-repair\", in which DSBs are resolved by an inappropriate repair pathway, can also promote genomic instability and presumably tumorigenesis. This notion has gained currency from recent cancer genome sequencing studies which have uncovered numerous chromosomal rearrangements harboring pathological DNA repair signatures. In this perspective, we discuss the factors that regulate DSB repair pathway choice and their consequences for genome stability and cancer.",

Deregulations in those developmental processes lead to medulloblastoma formation, the most common malignant brain tumor in childhood. Although the protein Atoh1 is a key factor during both cerebellar development and medulloblastoma formation, up-to-date detailed mechanisms underlying its function and regulation have remained poorly understood. Here, we report that SHH regulates Atoh1 stability by preventing its phosphodependent degradation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Huwe1. Our results reveal that SHH and Atoh1 contribute to a positive autoregulatory loop promoting neuronal precursor expansion. Consequently, Huwe1 loss in mouse SHH medulloblastoma illustrates the disruption of this developmental mechanism in cancer. Hence, the crosstalk between SHH signaling and Atoh1 during cerebellar development highlights a collaborative network that could be further targeted in medulloblastoma.",

We report here that the genomic region of the PHLDA3 gene undergoes loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at a remarkably high frequency in human PanNETs, and this genetic change is correlated with disease progression and poor prognosis. We also show that the PHLDA3 locus undergoes methylation in addition to LOH, suggesting that a two-hit inactivation of the PHLDA3 gene is required for PanNET development. We demonstrate that PHLDA3 represses Akt activity and Akt-regulated biological processes in pancreatic endocrine tissues, and that PHLDA3-deficient mice develop islet hyperplasia. In addition, we show that the tumor-suppressing pathway mediated by MEN1, a well-known tumor suppressor of PanNETs, is dependent on the pathway mediated by PHLDA3, and inactivation of PHLDA3 and MEN1 cooperatively contribute to PanNET development. Collectively, these results indicate the existence of a novel PHLDA3-mediated pathway of tumor suppression that is important in the development of PanNETs.",

A comparative analysis of microRNAs expressed in normal and malignant GC B cells identified microRNA 28 (miR-28) as significantly down-regulated in BL, as well as in other GC-derived B-NHL. We show that reexpression of miR-28 impairs cell proliferation and clonogenic properties of BL cells by modulating several targets including MAD2 mitotic arrest deficient-like 1, MAD2L1, a component of the spindle checkpoint whose down-regulation is essential in mediating miR-28-induced proliferation arrest, and BCL2-associated athanogene, BAG1, an activator of the ERK pathway. We identify the oncogene MYC as a negative regulator of miR-28 expression, suggesting that its deregulation by chromosomal translocation in BL leads to miR-28 suppression. In addition, we show that miR-28 can inhibit MYC-induced transformation by directly targeting genes up-regulated by MYC. Overall, our data suggest that miR-28 acts as a tumor suppressor in BL and that its repression by MYC contributes to B-cell lymphomagenesis.",

    "abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) is initiated by DNA end resection, a process in which stretches of single-strand DNA (ssDNA) are generated and used for homology search. Factors implicated in resection include nucleases MRE11, EXO1, and DNA2, which process DNA ends into 3' ssDNA overhangs; helicases such as BLM, which unwind DNA; and other proteins such as BRCA1 and CtIP whose functions remain unclear. CDK-mediated phosphorylation of CtIP on T847 is required to promote resection, whereas CDK-dependent phosphorylation of CtIP-S327 is required for interaction with BRCA1. Here, we provide evidence that CtIP functions independently of BRCA1 in promoting DSB end resection. First, using mouse models expressing S327A or T847A mutant CtIP as a sole species, and B cells deficient in CtIP, we show that loss of the CtIP-BRCA1 interaction does not detectably affect resection, maintenance of genomic stability or viability, whereas T847 is essential for these functions. Second, although loss of 53BP1 rescues the embryonic lethality and HR defects in BRCA1-deficient mice, it does not restore viability or genome integrity in CtIP(-/-) mice. Third, the increased resection afforded by loss of 53BP1 and the rescue of BRCA1-deficiency depend on CtIP but not EXO1. Finally, the sensitivity of BRCA1-deficient cells to poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibition is partially rescued by the phospho-mimicking mutant CtIP (CtIP-T847E). Thus, in contrast to BRCA1, CtIP has indispensable roles in promoting resection and embryonic development.",

Recently, a tumor suppressor function for the lipid phosphatase inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II (INPP4B) has been described in breast and prostate cancers, with impact on PI3K signaling output. Given the importance of PI3K pathway activity for melanoma formation and growth, we aimed to assess the role of INPP4B in melanocytic tumors. Our studies in native tumors suggest that decreased INPP4B expression is an event correlating with tumor progression in melanocytic neoplasms. We further demonstrate that INPP4B regulates PI3K/Akt signaling and exerts a tumor suppressor effect, impacting the proliferative, invasive, and tumorigenic capacity of melanoma cells. INPP4B expression in melanocytic neoplasms may therefore have potential as a biomarker for disease progression and as a modulator for the prediction of treatment outcome.",

Mechanistically, we show that miR-424(322)/503 orchestrates cell life and death decisions by targeting BCL-2 and IGF1R (insulin growth factor-1 receptor). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the expression of this microRNA cluster is regulated by TGF-\u03b2, a well-characterized regulator of mammary involution. Overall, our data suggest a model in which activation of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway after weaning induces the transcription of miR-424(322)/503, which in turn down-regulates the expression of key genes.

    "abstract": "Birth defects are a leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The vast majority of birth defects are nonsyndromic, and although their etiologies remain mostly unknown, evidence supports the hypothesis that they result from the complex interaction of genetic, epigenetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Since our last review published in 2002 describing the basic tools of genetic epidemiology used to study nonsyndromic structural birth defects, many new approaches have become available and have been used with varying success. Through rapid advances in genomic technologies, investigators are now able to investigate large portions of the genome at a fraction of previous costs. With next-generation sequencing, research has progressed from assessing a small percentage of single-nucleotide polymorphisms to assessing the entire human protein-coding repertoire (exome)-an approach that is starting to uncover rare but informative mutations associated with nonsyndromic birth defects. Herein, we report on the current state of the genetic epidemiology of birth defects and comment on future challenges and opportunities. We consider issues of study design, and we discuss common variant approaches, including candidate gene studies and genome-wide association studies. We also discuss the complexities embedded in exploring interactions between genes and the environment. We complete our review by describing new and promising next-generation sequencing technologies and examining how the study of epigenetic mechanisms could become the key to unraveling the complex etiologies of nonsyndromic structural birth defects.",

    "abstract": "Proneural glioblastoma is defined by an expression pattern resembling that of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and carries a distinctive set of genetic alterations. Whether there is a functional relationship between the proneural phenotype and the associated genetic alterations is unknown. To evaluate this possible relationship, we performed a longitudinal molecular characterization of tumor progression in a mouse model of proneural glioma. In this setting, the tumors acquired remarkably consistent genetic deletions at late stages of progression, similar to those deleted in human proneural glioblastoma. Further investigations revealed that p53 is a master regulator of the transcriptional network underlying the proneural phenotype. This p53-centric transcriptional network and its associated phenotype were observed at both the early and late stages of progression, and preceded the proneural-specific deletions. Remarkably, deletion of p53 at the time of tumor initiation obviated the acquisition of later deletions, establishing a link between the proneural transcriptional network and the subtype-specific deletions selected during glioma progression.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are a heterogeneous and poorly understood group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Here we combined whole-exome sequencing of 12 tumor-normal DNA pairs, RNA sequencing analysis and targeted deep sequencing to identify new genetic alterations in PTCL transformation. These analyses identified highly recurrent epigenetic factor mutations in TET2, DNMT3A and IDH2 as well as a new highly prevalent RHOA mutation encoding a p.Gly17Val alteration present in 22 of 35 (67%) angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) samples and in 8 of 44 (18%) PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) samples. Mechanistically, the RHOA Gly17Val protein interferes with RHOA signaling in biochemical and cellular assays, an effect potentially mediated by the sequestration of activated guanine-exchange factor (GEF) proteins. In addition, we describe new and recurrent, albeit less frequent, genetic defects including mutations in FYN, ATM, B2M and CD58 implicating SRC signaling, impaired DNA damage response and escape from immune surveillance mechanisms in the pathogenesis of PTCL.",

The pathogenesis of this process remains largely unknown. Using whole-exome sequencing and copy-number analysis, we show here that the dominant clone of FL and transformed FL (tFL) arise by divergent evolution from a common mutated precursor through the acquisition of distinct genetic events. Mutations in epigenetic modifiers and antiapoptotic genes are introduced early in the common precursor, whereas tFL is specifically associated with alterations deregulating cell-cycle progression and DNA damage responses (CDKN2A/B, MYC, and TP53) as\u00a0well as aberrant somatic hypermutation. The genomic profile of tFL shares similarities with that of germinal center B cell-type de novo DLBCL but also displays unique combinations of altered genes with diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

Beyond the sheer numerical diversity of RNA species, recent studies have begun to uncover hints of even greater functional complexity. An increasing number of RNA molecules, including those from classic, well-studied classes, have been found to act in previously unanticipated regulatory roles, or as substrate for the biogenesis of functionally distinct RNA molecules, or both. Thus, these molecules can fulfill multiple, parallel functions, compounding the already rich landscape of RNA biology, and potentially connecting disparate biological regulatory networks in unexpected ways. In this article, we review recently discovered instances of RNA multifunctionality, with a particular focus on regulatory small RNAs.",

    "abstract": "The interactions between the nephrogenic mesenchyme and the ureteric bud during kidney development are well documented. While recent studies have shed some light on the importance of the stroma during renal development, many of the signals generated in the stroma, the genetic pathways and interaction networks involving the stroma are yet to be identified. Our previous studies demonstrate that retinoids are crucial for branching of the ureteric bud and for patterning of the cortical stroma. In the present study we demonstrate that autocrine retinoic acid (RA) signaling in stromal cells is critical for their survival and patterning, and show that Extracellular matrix 1, Ecm1, a gene that in humans causes irritable bowel syndrome and lipoid proteinosis, is a novel RA-regulated target in the developing kidney, which is secreted from the cortical stromal cells surrounding the cap mesenchyme and ureteric bud. Our studies suggest that Ecm1 is required in the ureteric bud for regulating the distribution of Ret which is normally restricted to the tips, as inhibition of Ecm1 results in an expanded domain of Ret expression and reduced numbers of branches. We propose a model in which retinoid signaling in the stroma activates expression of Ecm1, which in turn down-regulates Ret expression in the ureteric bud cleft, where bifurcation normally occurs and normal branching progresses.",

Here, we identify the AKT1 kinase as a major negative regulator of the NR3C1 glucocorticoid receptor protein activity driving glucocorticoid resistance in T-ALL. Mechanistically, AKT1 impairs glucocorticoid-induced gene expression by direct phosphorylation of NR3C1 at position S134 and blocking glucocorticoid-induced NR3C1 translocation to the nucleus. Moreover, we demonstrate that loss of PTEN and consequent AKT1 activation can effectively block glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and induce resistance to glucocorticoid therapy. Conversely, pharmacologic inhibition of AKT with MK2206 effectively restores glucocorticoid-induced NR3C1 translocation to the nucleus, increases the response of T-ALL cells to glucocorticoid therapy, and effectively reverses glucocorticoid resistance in vitro and in vivo.",

    "title": "Genetic lesions associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia transformation to Richter syndrome",
    "abstract": "Richter syndrome (RS) derives from the rare transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) into an aggressive lymphoma, most commonly of the diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) type. The molecular pathogenesis of RS is only partially understood. By combining whole-exome sequencing and copy-number analysis of 9 CLL-RS pairs and of an extended panel of 43 RS cases, we show that this aggressive disease typically arises from the predominant CLL clone by acquiring an average of \u223c20 genetic lesions/case. RS lesions are heterogeneous in terms of load and spectrum among patients, and include those involved in CLL progression and chemorefractoriness (TP53 disruption and NOTCH1 activation) as well as some not previously implicated in CLL or RS pathogenesis. In particular, disruption of the CDKN2A/B cell cycle regulator is associated with \u223c30% of RS cases. Finally, we report that the genomic landscape of RS is significantly different from that of de novo DLBCL, suggesting that they represent distinct disease entities. These results provide insights into RS pathogenesis, and identify dysregulated pathways of potential diagnostic and therapeutic relevance.",

Here, we report the identification of germline homozygous SH2B3 mutations in 2 siblings affected with developmental delay and autoimmunity, one in whom B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) developed. Mechanistically, loss of SH2B3 increases Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling, promotes lymphoid cell proliferation, and accelerates leukemia development in a mouse model of NOTCH1-induced ALL. Moreover, extended mutation analysis showed homozygous somatic mutations in SH2B3 in 2 of 167 ALLs analyzed. Overall, these results demonstrate a Knudson tumor suppressor role for SH2B3 in the pathogenesis of ALL and highlight a possible link between genetic predisposition factors in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity and leukemogenesis.",

Here we found that MEF2B directly activated the transcription of the proto-oncogene BCL6 in normal germinal-center (GC) B cells and was required for DLBCL proliferation. Mutation of MEF2B resulted in enhanced transcriptional activity of MEF2B either through disruption of its interaction with the corepressor CABIN1 or by rendering it insensitive to inhibitory signaling events mediated by phosphorylation and sumoylation. Consequently, the transcriptional activity of Bcl-6 was deregulated in DLBCLs with MEF2B mutations. Thus, somatic mutations of MEF2B may contribute to lymphomagenesis by deregulating BCL6 expression, and MEF2B may represent an alternative target for blocking Bcl-6 activity in DLBCLs.",

Here, we report the development of an unbiased method for computational integration of copy number variation, expression, and mutation data from large datasets. Using this method, we identified rhophilin 2 (RHPN2) as a central genetic determinant of the mesenchymal phenotype of human GBM. Notably, amplification of the human RHPN2 gene on chromosome 19 correlates with a dramatic decrease in the survival of patients with glioma. Ectopic expression of RHPN2 in neural stem cells and astrocytes triggered the expression of mesenchymal genes and promoted an invasive phenotype without impacting cell proliferation. Mechanistically, these effects were implemented through RHPN2-mediated activation of RhoA, a master regulator of cell migration and invasion. Our results define RHPN2 amplification as a central genetic determinant of a highly aggressive phenotype that directs the worst clinical outcomes in patients with GBM.",

    "title": "Comparative anatomy of chromosomal domains with imprinted and non-imprinted allele-specific DNA methylation",
    "abstract": "Allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM) is well studied in imprinted domains, but this type of epigenetic asymmetry is actually found more commonly at non-imprinted loci, where the ASM is dictated not by parent-of-origin but instead by the local haplotype. We identified loci with strong ASM in human tissues from methylation-sensitive SNP array data. Two index regions (bisulfite PCR amplicons), one between the C3orf27 and RPN1 genes in chromosome band 3q21 and the other near the VTRNA2-1 vault RNA in band 5q31, proved to be new examples of imprinted DMRs (maternal alleles methylated) while a third, between STEAP3 and C2orf76 in chromosome band 2q14, showed non-imprinted haplotype-dependent ASM. Using long-read bisulfite sequencing (bis-seq) in 8 human tissues we found that in all 3 domains the ASM is restricted to single differentially methylated regions (DMRs), each less than 2kb. The ASM in the C3orf27-RPN1 intergenic region was placenta-specific and associated with allele-specific expression of a long non-coding RNA. Strikingly, the discrete DMRs in all 3 regions overlap with binding sites for the insulator protein CTCF, which we found selectively bound to the unmethylated allele of the STEAP3-C2orf76 DMR. Methylation mapping in two additional genes with non-imprinted haplotype-dependent ASM, ELK3 and CYP2A7, showed that the CYP2A7 DMR also overlaps a CTCF site. Thus, two features of imprinted domains, highly localized DMRs and allele-specific insulator occupancy by CTCF, can also be found in chromosomal domains with non-imprinted ASM. Arguing for biological importance, our analysis of published whole genome bis-seq data from hES cells revealed multiple genome-wide association study (GWAS) peaks near CTCF binding sites with ASM.",

    "abstract": "ARF suppresses aberrant cell growth upon c-Myc overexpression by activating p53 responses. Nevertheless, the precise mechanism by which ARF specifically restrains the oncogenic potential of c-Myc without affecting its normal physiological function is not well understood. Here, we show that low levels of c-Myc expression stimulate cell proliferation, whereas high levels inhibit by activating the ARF/p53 response. Although the mRNA levels of ARF are induced in both scenarios, the accumulation of ARF protein occurs only when ULF-mediated degradation of ARF is inhibited by c-Myc overexpression. Moreover, the levels of ARF are reduced through ULF-mediated ubiquitination upon DNA damage. Blocking ARF degradation by c-Myc overexpression dramatically stimulates the apoptotic responses. Our study reveals that ARF stability control is crucial for differentiating normal (low) versus oncogenic (high) levels of c-Myc expression and suggests that differential effects on ULF- mediated ARF ubiquitination by c-Myc levels act as a barrier in oncogene-induced stress responses.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies indicate the importance of acetylation in p53-mediated stress responses upon DNA damage. We and others previously showed that TIP60 (Tat-interacting protein of 60 kDa)-mediated acetylation of p53 at K120 is crucial for p53-dependent apoptotic responses. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how TIP60-mediated effects on p53 are dynamically regulated in vivo. Here, we report that UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like with PHD and RING finger domains 1) interacts with TIP60 both in vitro and in vivo and induces degradation-independent ubiquitination of TIP60. Moreover, UHRF1 expression markedly suppresses the ability of TIP60 to acetylate p53. In contrast, RNAi-mediated knockdown of UHRF1 increases the endogenous levels of p53 acetylation at K120 and p53-mediated apoptosis is significantly enhanced in UHRF1-depleted cells. To elucidate the mechanisms of this regulation, we found that the interaction between TIP60 and p53 is severely inhibited in the presence of UHRF1, suggesting that UHRF1 modulates TIP60-mediated functions in both K120 acetylation-dependent and -independent manners. Consistent with this notion, UHRF1 knockdown promotes activation of p21 and PUMA but not MDM2. These findings demonstrate that UHRF1 is a critical negative regulator of TIP60 and suggest that UHRF1-mediated effects on p53 may contribute, at least in part, to its role in tumorigenesis.",

An early immature gene expression signature, the absence of bi-allelic TCRG deletion, CD13 surface expression, heterozygous deletions of the short arm of chromosome 17, and mutations in IDH1/IDH2 and DNMT3A genes are associated with poor prognosis in this series. In contrast, expression of CD8 or CD62L, homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/CDKN2B, NOTCH1 and/or FBXW7 mutations, and mutations or deletions in the BCL11B tumor suppressor gene were associated with improved overall survival. Importantly, the prognostic relevance of CD13 expression and homozygous CDKN2A/CDKN2B deletions was restricted to cortical and mature T-ALLs. Conversely, mutations in IDH1/IDH2 and DNMT3A were specifically associated with poor outcome in early immature adult T-ALLs. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00002514.",

The BRCA1 tumor suppressor, which interacts with CtIP in a phospho-dependent manner, has also been implicated in DSB repair through the HDR pathway. It was recently reported that the BRCA1-CtIP interaction is essential for HDR in chicken DT40 cells. To examine the role of this interaction in mammalian cells, we generated cells and mice that express Ctip polypeptides (Ctip-S326A) that fail to bind BRCA1. Surprisingly, isogenic lines of Ctip-S326A mutant and wild-type cells displayed comparable levels of HDR function and chromosomal stability. Although Ctip-S326A mutant cells were modestly sensitive to topoisomerase inhibitors, mice expressing Ctip-S326A polypeptides developed normally and did not exhibit a predisposition to cancer. Thus, in mammals, the phospho-dependent BRCA1-CtIP interaction is not essential for HDR-mediated DSB repair or for tumor suppression.",

    "abstract": "Depending on the circumstance, FOXO (Forkhead O) (FOXO1, FOXO3, and FOXO4) transcription factors activate the expression of markedly different sets of genes to produce different phenotypic effects. For example, distinct FOXO-regulated transcriptional programs stimulate cell death or enhance organism life span. To gain insight into how FOXOs select specific genes for regulation, we performed a screen for genes that modify FOXO activation of TRAIL, a death receptor ligand capable of inducing extrinsic apoptosis. We discovered that the bZIP transcriptional repressor NFIL3 (nuclear factor interleukin 3-regulated) hindered FOXO transcription factor access to chromatin at the TRAIL promoter by binding to nearby DNA and recruiting histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2) to reduce histone acetylation. In the same manner, NFIL3 repressed expression of certain FOXO targets--e.g., FAS, GADD45\u03b1 (growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible, \u03b1), and GADD45\u03b2--but not others. NFIL3, which we found to be overexpressed in different cancers, supported tumor cell survival largely through repression of TRAIL and antagonized hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death. Moreover, its expression in cancer was associated with lower patient survival. Therefore, NFIL3 alters cancer cell behavior and FOXO function by acting on chromatin to restrict the menu of FOXO target genes. Targeting of NFIL3 could be of therapeutic benefit for cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "The PTEN tumor suppressor is a lipid phosphatase that has a central role in regulating the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signal transduction cascade. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which the PTEN activity is regulated in cells needs further elucidation. Although previous studies have shown that ubiquitination of PTEN can modulate its stability and subcellular localization, the role of ubiquitination in the most critical aspect of PTEN function, its phosphatase activity, has not been fully addressed. Here, we identify a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase of PTEN, Ret finger protein (RFP), that is able to promote atypical polyubiquitinations of PTEN. These ubiquitinations do not lead to PTEN instability or relocalization, but rather significantly inhibit PTEN phosphatase activity and therefore modulate its ability to regulate the PI3K signal transduction cascade. Indeed, RFP overexpression relieves PTEN-mediated inhibitory effects on AKT activation; in contrast, RNAi-mediated knockdown of endogenous RFP enhances the ability of PTEN to suppress AKT activation. Moreover, RFP-mediated ubiquitination of PTEN inhibits PTEN-dependent activation of TRAIL expression and also suppresses its ability to induce apoptosis. Our findings demonstrate a crucial role of RFP-mediated ubiquitination in controlling PTEN activity.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer can be classified into different molecular subtypes with varying clinical and pathological characteristics. The basal-like breast cancer subtype represents one of the most aggressive and lethal types of breast cancer, and due to poor mechanistic understanding, it lacks targeted therapy. Many basal-like breast cancer patient samples display alterations of established drivers of cancer development, including elevated expression of EGFR, p53 inactivating mutations and loss of expression of the tumor suppressor PTEN; however, their contribution to human basal-like breast cancer pathogenesis remains ill-defined. Using non-transformed human mammary epithelial cells, we set out to determine whether altering EGFR, p53 and PTEN in different combinations could contribute to basal-like breast cancer progression through transformation of cells. Altering PTEN in combination with either p53 or EGFR in contrast to any of the single alterations caused increased growth of transformed colonies in soft agar. Concomitantly modifying all three genes led to the highest rate of cellular proliferation and the greatest degree of anchorage-independent colony formation. Results from our effort to engineer a model of BBC expressing alterations of EGFR, p53 and PTEN suggest that these changes are cooperative and likely play a causal role in basal-like breast cancer pathogenesis. Consideration should be given to targeting EGFR and restoring p53 and PTEN signaling simultaneously as a strategy for treatment of this subtype of breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "It is well established that the p53 tumor suppressor plays a crucial role in controlling cell proliferation and apoptosis upon various types of stress. There is increasing evidence showing that p53 is also critically involved in various metabolic pathways, both in tumor and normal cells. Here, we have identified a novel p53 metabolic target pantothenate kinase-1 (PANK1) via ChIP-on-chip. PanK1 catalyzes the rate-limiting step for CoA synthesis and, therefore, controls intracellular CoA content; Pank1-knockout mice exhibit defect in \u03b2-oxidation and gluconeogenesis in the liver after starvation due to insufficient CoA levels. We demonstrated that PANK1 gene is a direct transcriptional target of p53. Although DNA damage-induced p53 upregulates PanK1 expression, depletion of PanK1 expression does not affect p53-dependent growth arrest or apoptosis. Interestingly, upon glucose starvation, PanK1 expression is significantly reduced in HCT116 p53 (-/-) but not in HCT116 p53 (+/+) cells, suggesting that p53 is required to maintain PanK1 expression under metabolic stress conditions. Moreover, by using p53-mutant mice, we observed that, similar to the case in Pank1-knockout mice, gluconeogenesis is partially impaired in p53-null mice. Together, our findings show that p53 plays an important role in regulating energy homeostasis through transcriptional control of PANK1, independent of its canonical functions in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.",

    "abstract": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive hematological tumor resulting from the malignant transformation of lymphoid progenitors. Despite intensive chemotherapy, 20% of pediatric patients and over 50% of adult patients with ALL do not achieve a complete remission or relapse after intensified chemotherapy, making disease relapse and resistance to therapy the most substantial challenge in the treatment of this disease. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identify mutations in the cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II gene (NT5C2), which encodes a 5'-nucleotidase enzyme that is responsible for the inactivation of nucleoside-analog chemotherapy drugs, in 20/103 (19%) relapse T cell ALLs and 1/35 (3%) relapse B-precursor ALLs. NT5C2 mutant proteins show increased nucleotidase activity in vitro and conferred resistance to chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine when expressed in ALL lymphoblasts. These results support a prominent role for activating mutations in NT5C2 and increased nucleoside-analog metabolism in disease progression and chemotherapy resistance in ALL.",

Homology-directed repair (HDR) is initiated by resection of DSBs to generate 3' single-stranded DNA overhangs. How resection and HDR are activated during DDR is not known, nor are the roles of ATM and ATR in HDR. Here, we show that CtIP undergoes ATR-dependent hyperphosphorylation in response to DSBs. ATR phosphorylates an invariant threonine, T818 of Xenopus CtIP (T859 in human). Nonphosphorylatable CtIP (T818A) does not bind to chromatin or initiate resection. Our data support a model in which ATM activity is required for an early step in resection, leading to ATR activation, CtIP-T818 phosphorylation, and accumulation of CtIP on chromatin. Chromatin binding by modified CtIP precedes extensive resection and full checkpoint activation.",

To develop a physiologically relevant model for studying the biochemistry of RCAN1 and its contribution to DS, we generated bacterial artificial chromosome-transgenic (BAC-Tg) mouse lines containing the human RCAN1 gene with a C-terminal HA-FLAG epitope tag incorporated by recombineering. The BAC-Tg was expressed at levels only moderately higher than the native Rcan1 gene: approximately 1.5-fold in RCAN1                 (BAC-Tg1) and twofold in RCAN1                 (BAC-Tg2). Affinity purification of the RCAN1 protein complex from brains of these mice revealed a core complex of RCAN1 with CaN, glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (Gsk3b), and calmodulin, with substoichiometric components, including LOC73419. The BAC-Tg mice are fully viable, but long-term synaptic potentiation is impaired in proportion to BAC-Tg dosage in hippocampal brain slices from these mice. RCAN1 can act as a tumor suppressor in some systems, but we found that the RCAN1 BAC-Tg did not reduce mammary cancer growth when present at a low copy number in Tp53;WAP-Cre mice. This work establishes a useful mouse model for investigating the biochemistry and dose-dependent functions of the RCAN1 protein in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Sequencing studies from several model systems have suggested that diverse and abundant small RNAs may be derived from tRNA, but the function of these molecules remains undefined. Here, we demonstrate that one such tRNA-derived fragment, cloned from human mature B cells and designated CU1276, in fact possesses the functional characteristics of a microRNA, including a DICER1-dependent biogenesis, physical association with Argonaute proteins, and the ability to repress mRNA transcripts in a sequence-specific manner. Expression of CU1276 is abundant in normal germinal center B cells but absent in germinal center-derived lymphomas, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Furthermore, CU1276 represses endogenous RPA1, an essential gene involved in many aspects of DNA dynamics, and consequently, expression of this tRNA-derived microRNA in a lymphoma cell line suppresses proliferation and modulates the molecular response to DNA damage. These results establish that functionally active microRNAs can be derived from tRNA, thus defining a class of genetic entities with potentially important biological roles.",

To test epigenetic therapy against this cancer, we used the DNA demethylating drug 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) in an aggressive mouse model of stromal rich PDAC (KPC-Brca1 mice). In untreated tumors, we found globally decreased 5-methyl-cytosine (5-mC) in malignant epithelial cells and in cancer-associated myofibroblasts (CAF), along with increased amounts of 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine (5-HmC) in CAFs, in progression from pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia to PDAC. DAC further reduced DNA methylation and slowed PDAC progression, markedly extending survival in an early-treatment protocol and significantly though transiently inhibiting tumor growth when initiated later, without adverse side effects. Escaping tumors contained areas of sarcomatoid transformation with disappearance of CAFs. Mixing-allografting experiments and proliferation indices showed that DAC efficacy was due to inhibition of both the malignant epithelial cells and the CAFs. Expression profiling and immunohistochemistry highlighted DAC induction of STAT1 in the tumors, and DAC plus IFN-\u03b3 produced an additive antiproliferative effect on PDAC cells. DAC induced strong expression of the testis antigen deleted in azoospermia-like (DAZL) in CAFs. These data show that DAC is effective against PDAC in vivo and provide a rationale for future studies combining hypomethylating agents with cytokines and immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "High-grade gliomas (HGGs) are incurable brain tumors that are characterized by the presence of glioma-initiating cells (GICs). GICs are essential to tumor aggressiveness and retain the capacity for self-renewal and multilineage differentiation as long as they reside in the perivascular niche. ID proteins are master regulators of stemness and anchorage to the extracellular niche microenvironment, suggesting that they may play a role in maintaining GICs. Here, we modeled the probable therapeutic impact of ID inactivation in HGG by selective ablation of Id in tumor cells and after tumor initiation in a new mouse model of human mesenchymal HGG. Deletion of 3 Id genes induced rapid release of GICs from the perivascular niche, followed by tumor regression. GIC displacement was mediated by derepression of Rap1gap and subsequent inhibition of RAP1, a master regulator of cell adhesion. We identified a signature module of 5 genes in the ID pathway, including RAP1GAP, which segregated 2 subgroups of glioma patients with markedly different clinical outcomes. The model-informed survival analysis together with genetic and functional studies establish that ID activity is required for the maintenance of mesenchymal HGG and suggest that pharmacological inactivation of ID proteins could serve as a therapeutic strategy.",

    "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a powerful genetic strategy to functionally interrogate the entire genome by loss-of-function studies. In the last years, several arrayed shRNA libraries that can silence almost all the human genome have been developed. The generation of new and more efficient shRNA plasmids has allowed performing genetic screens in a pooled fashion and provides the opportunity to investigate the entire genome finding relevant genes to any biological process. In this chapter, the pipeline and methods to perform a pooled shRNA screen are discussed.",

The analysis of gene expression patterns of lymphomas and normal lymphocytes permits (1) the definition of molecular subtypes of lymphoma; (2) the identification of the normal cellular counterpart of a lymphoma subtype; (3) the identification of diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets; and (4) the identification of signaling pathways affected by the oncogenic transformation.

    "abstract": "The BCL6 proto-oncogene encodes a transcriptional repressor that is required for germinal center (GC) formation and whose de-regulation is involved in lymphomagenesis. Although substantial evidence indicates that BCL6 exerts its function by repressing the transcription of hundreds of protein-coding genes, its potential role in regulating gene expression via microRNAs (miRNAs) is not known. We have identified a core of 15 miRNAs that show binding of BCL6 in their genomic loci and are down-regulated in GC B cells. Among BCL6 validated targets, miR-155 and miR-361 directly modulate AID expression, indicating that via repression of these miRNAs, BCL6 up-regulates AID. Similarly, the expression of additional genes relevant for the GC phenotype, including SPI1, IRF8, and MYB, appears to be sustained via BCL6-mediated repression of miR-155. These findings identify a novel mechanism by which BCL6, in addition to repressing protein coding genes, promotes the expression of important GC functions by repressing specific miRNAs.",

Mutants with greater affinity for the antigen are positively selected in the light zone (LZ) to either differentiate into plasma and memory cells or reenter the DZ. The molecular circuits that govern positive selection in the GC are not known. We show here that the GC reaction required biphasic regulation of expression of the cell-cycle regulator c-Myc that involved its transient induction during early GC commitment, its repression by Bcl-6 in DZ B cells and its reinduction in B cells selected for reentry into the DZ. Inhibition of c-Myc in vivo led to GC collapse, which indicated an essential role for c-Myc in GCs. Our results have implications for the mechanism of GC selection and the role of c-Myc in lymphomagenesis.",

    "abstract": "The brain tumor glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is among the most lethal forms of human cancer. Here, we report that a small subset of GBMs (3.1%; 3 of 97 tumors examined) harbors oncogenic chromosomal translocations that fuse in-frame the tyrosine kinase coding domains of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) genes (FGFR1 or FGFR3) to the transforming acidic coiled-coil (TACC) coding domains of TACC1 or TACC3, respectively. The FGFR-TACC fusion protein displays oncogenic activity when introduced into astrocytes or stereotactically transduced in the mouse brain. The fusion protein, which localizes to mitotic spindle poles, has constitutive kinase activity and induces mitotic and chromosomal segregation defects and triggers aneuploidy. Inhibition of FGFR kinase corrects the aneuploidy, and oral administration of an FGFR inhibitor prolongs survival of mice harboring intracranial FGFR3-TACC3-initiated glioma. FGFR-TACC fusions could potentially identify a subset of GBM patients who would benefit from targeted FGFR kinase inhibition.",

In this paper, we report that mice carrying homozygous kinase-dead mutations in Atm (Atm(KD/KD)) died during early embryonic development. Atm(KD/-) cells exhibited proliferation defects and genomic instability, especially chromatid breaks, at levels higher than Atm(-/-) cells. Despite this increased genomic instability, Atm(KD/-) lymphocytes progressed through variable, diversity, and joining recombination and immunoglobulin class switch recombination, two events requiring nonhomologous end joining, at levels comparable to Atm(-/-) lymphocytes. Together, these results reveal an essential function of ATM during embryogenesis and an important function of catalytically inactive ATM protein in DNA repair.",

Here, we show that the Y family DNA polymerase kappa (Pol \u03ba) is essential for RIR of a site-specific ICL lesion in Xenopus egg extracts, and that both its catalytic activity and UBZ domains are required for this function. We also demonstrate a requirement for PCNA and its modification on lysine 164. Finally, we show that Pol \u03ba participates in ICL repair in mammalian cells, particularly in G0.

Early studies identified NOTCH1 as an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of T-ALL through the use of \u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSI). Here, we characterized the interaction between PF-03084014, a clinically relevant GSI, and dexamethasone in preclinical models of glucocorticoid-resistant T-ALL. Combination treatment of the GSI PF-03084014 with glucocorticoids induced a synergistic antileukemic effect in human T-ALL cell lines and primary human T-ALL patient samples. Mechanistically PF-03084014 plus glucocorticoid treatment induced increased transcriptional upregulation of the glucocorticoid receptor and glucocorticoid target genes. Treatment with PF-03084014 and glucocorticoids in combination was highly efficacious in vivo, with enhanced reduction of tumor burden in a xenograft model of T-ALL. Finally, glucocorticoid treatment effectively reversed PF-03084014-induced gastrointestinal toxicity via inhibition of goblet cell metaplasia. These results warrant the analysis of PF-03084014 and glucocorticoids in combination for the treatment of glucocorticoid-resistant T-ALL.",

    "abstract": "Cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence are widely accepted as the major mechanisms by which p53 inhibits tumor formation. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether they are the rate-limiting steps in tumor suppression. Here, we have generated mice bearing lysine to arginine mutations at one (p53(K117R)) or three (p53(3KR); K117R+K161R+K162R) of p53 acetylation sites. Although p53(K117R/K117R) cells are competent for p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest and senescence, but not apoptosis, all three of these processes are ablated in p53(3KR/3KR) cells. Surprisingly, unlike p53 null mice, which rapidly succumb to spontaneous thymic lymphomas, early-onset tumor formation does not occur in either p53(K117R/K117R) or p53(3KR/3KR) animals. Notably, p53(3KR) retains the ability to regulate energy metabolism and reactive oxygen species production. These findings underscore the crucial role of acetylation in differentially modulating p53 responses and suggest that unconventional activities of p53, such as metabolic regulation and antioxidant function, are critical for suppression of early-onset spontaneous tumorigenesis.",

Polypeptides translated from truncated transcripts encoded by the NOTCH1 deletion allele retain the transmembrane domain of the receptor and are constitutively cleaved by the \u03b3-secretase complex, resulting in high levels of NOTCH1 signaling that can be effectively blocked by \u03b3-secretase inhibitors.

Multiple mechanisms act coordinately to timely modulate BCL6 expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. BCL6 prevents premature activation and differentiation of GC B cells and provides an environment tolerant of the DNA breaks associated with immunoglobulin gene remodeling mechanisms involved in the production of high-affinity antibodies of different isotypes. The critical functions exerted by BCL6 during normal B-cell development can be hijacked by the malignant transformation process. Indeed, BCL6 is targeted by genetic aberrations and acts as an oncogene in GC-derived lymphomas. The aberrations affecting BCL6 interfere with the multiple levels of regulation that grant a fine tuning of BCL6 expression and activity in physiologic conditions.

    "abstract": "Stem-cell functions require activation of stem-cell-intrinsic transcriptional programs and extracellular interaction with a niche microenvironment. How the transcriptional machinery controls residency of stem cells in the niche is unknown. Here we show that Id proteins coordinate stem-cell activities with anchorage of neural stem cells (NSCs) to the niche. Conditional inactivation of three Id genes in NSCs triggered detachment of embryonic and postnatal NSCs from the ventricular and vascular niche, respectively. The interrogation of the gene modules directly targeted by Id deletion in NSCs revealed that Id proteins repress bHLH-mediated activation of Rap1GAP, thus serving to maintain the GTPase activity of RAP1, a key mediator of cell adhesion. Preventing the elevation of the Rap1GAP level countered the consequences of Id loss on NSC-niche interaction and stem-cell identity. Thus, by preserving anchorage of NSCs to the extracellular environment, Id activity synchronizes NSC functions to residency in the specialized niche.",

    "abstract": "Deletion of chromosomal region 13q14 represents the most common genetic aberration in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). 13q14 deletions are commonly large and heterogeneous in size and affect multiple genes. We recently found that targeted deletion in mice of the 0.11 megabase (mb)-long minimal deleted region (MDR) encompassing the DLEU2/miR-15a/16-1 cluster recapitulates the spectrum of CLL-associated lymphoproliferations in humans, including CLL, CD5(+) monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, and CD5(-) non-Hodgkin lymphomas. In the present study, we demonstrate that additional deletion of the 0.69-mb large genomic region telomeric to the MDR called the common deleted region (CDR) changed the spectrum of lymphoproliferations developing in CDR- versus MDR-deleted mice in that the number of CLL among B-cell lymphoproliferations was significantly elevated in the former. In addition, CDR-deleted mice seemed to succumb to their disease faster than MDR-deleted mice. Comparing HCDR3 regions of CD5(+) lymphoproliferations derived from this and published CLL mouse models, 44% (29 of 66) of junctions could be assigned to 8 sets of highly similar HCDR3 regions, demonstrating that CLL developing in mice frequently expresses almost identical, stereotypic Ag receptors. These results suggest that the size of 13q14 deletions influences the phenotype of the developing lymphoproliferations and potentially the severity of disease, suggesting a tumor-suppressor function for genetic elements in addition to DLEU2/miR-15a/16-1.",

    "abstract": "Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), a major pathway of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, is required during lymphocyte development to resolve the programmed DSBs generated during Variable, Diverse, and Joining [V(D)J] recombination. XRCC4-like factor (XLF) (also called Cernunnos or NHEJ1) is a unique component of the NHEJ pathway. Although germ-line mutations of other NHEJ factors abrogate lymphocyte development and lead to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), XLF mutations cause a progressive lymphocytopenia that is generally less severe than SCID. Accordingly, XLF-deficient murine lymphocytes show no measurable defects in V(D)J recombination. We reported earlier that ATM kinase and its substrate histone H2AX are both essential for V(D)J recombination in XLF-deficient lymphocytes, despite moderate role in V(D)J recombination in WT cells. p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) is another substrate of ATM. 53BP1 deficiency led to small reduction of peripheral lymphocyte number by compromising both synapse and end-joining at modest level during V(D)J recombination. Here, we report that 53BP1/XLF double deficiency blocks lymphocyte development at early progenitor stages, owing to severe defects in end joining during chromosomal V(D)J recombination. The unrepaired DNA ends are rapidly degraded in 53BP1(-/-)XLF(-/-) cells, as reported for H2AX(-/-)XLF(-/-) cells, revealing an end protection role for 53BP1 reminiscent of H2AX. In contrast to the early embryonic lethality of H2AX(-/-)XLF(-/-) mice, 53BP1(-/-)XLF(-/-) mice are born alive and develop thymic lymphomas with translocations involving the T-cell receptor loci. Together, our findings identify a unique function for 53BP1 in end-joining and tumor suppression.",

    "abstract": "MDM2 oncogenic protein is the principal cellular antagonist of the p53 tumor suppresser gene. p53 activity needs exquisite control to elicit appropriate responses to differential cellular stress conditions. p53 becomes stabilized and active upon various types of stresses. However, too much p53 is not beneficial to cells and causes lethality. At the steady state, p53 activity needs to be leashed for cell survival. Early studies suggested that the MDM2 oncoprotein negatively regulates p53 activity through the induction of p53 protein degradation. MDM2 serves as an E3 ubiquitin ligase of p53; it catalyzes polyubiquitination and subsequently induces proteasome degradation to downregulate p53 protein level. However, the mechanism by which MDM2 represses p53 is not a single mode. Emerging evidence reveals another cellular location of MDM2-p53 interaction. MDM2 is recruited to chromatin, specifically the p53 responsive promoter regions, in a p53 dependent manner. MDM2 is proposed to directly inhibit p53 transactivity at chromatin. This article provides an overview of the mechanism by which p53 is repressed by MDM2 in both ubiquitination dependent and ubiquitination independent pathways.",

Here we used reverse engineering of global transcriptional networks to decipher the oncogenic regulatory circuit controlled by TLX1 and TLX3. This systems biology analysis defined T cell leukemia homeobox 1 (TLX1) and TLX3 as master regulators of an oncogenic transcriptional circuit governing T-ALL. Notably, a network structure analysis of this hierarchical network identified RUNX1 as a key mediator of the T-ALL induced by TLX1 and TLX3 and predicted a tumor-suppressor role for RUNX1 in T cell transformation. Consistent with these results, we identified recurrent somatic loss-of-function mutations in RUNX1 in human T-ALL. Overall, these results place TLX1 and TLX3 at the top of an oncogenic transcriptional network controlling leukemia development, show the power of network analyses to identify key elements in the regulatory circuits governing human cancer and identify RUNX1 as a tumor-suppressor gene in T-ALL.",

    "abstract": "It is well accepted that the Mdm2 ubiquitin ligase acts as a major factor in controlling p53 stability and activity in vivo. Although several E3 ligases have been reported to be involved in Mdm2-independent p53 degradation, the roles of these ligases in p53 regulation in vivo remain largely unknown. To elucidate the physiological role of the ubiquitin ligase ARF-BP1, we generated arf-bp1 mutant mice. We found that inactivation of arf-bp1 during embryonic development in mice resulted in p53 activation and embryonic lethality, but the mice with arf-bp1 deletion specifically in the pancreatic \u03b2-cells (arf-bp1(FL/Y)/RIP-cre) were viable and displayed no obvious abnormality after birth. Interestingly, these mice showed dramatic loss of \u03b2-cells as mice aged, and >50% of these mice died of severe diabetic symptoms before reaching 1 year of age. Notably, the diabetic phenotype of these mice was largely reversed by concomitant deletion of p53, and the life span of the mice was significantly extended (p53(LFL/FL)/arf-bp1(FL/Y)/RIP-cre). These findings underscore an important role of ARF-BP1 in maintaining \u03b2-cell homeostasis in aging mice and reveal that the stability of p53 is critically regulated by ARF-BP1 in vivo.",

Even with a high rate of success in the treatment of early stages of this malignancy, currently there are no effective strategies for the treatment of advanced metastatic melanoma. Much effort has been put into the use of different target-specific drugs, among which BRAF kinase-specific small-molecule inhibitors have rendered promising results as therapeutic agents in metastatic melanoma. Nonetheless, some side effects, such as development of SCC (squamous cell carcinoma), as well as tumour resistance and recurrence, are common limitations of this therapeutic strategy. The use of combination treatments in which different regulatory pathways or the immunological response are targeted seems to be a promising tool for the future success of melanoma therapeutics.",

In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a tumor resulting from the malignant transformation of T-cell progenitors, aberrant and constitutively active NOTCH1 signaling triggered by activating mutations in the NOTCH1 gene contributes to oncogenic transformation and is a hallmark of this disease. Most notably, small molecule \u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) can effectively block NOTCH1 signaling in T-ALL, and could be exploited as a targeted therapy in this disease. In addition, a number of emerging anti-NOTCH therapeutic strategies including anti-NOTCH1 inhibitory antibodies, small peptide inhibitors of NOTCH signaling and combination therapies with GSIs and glucocorticoids, have recently been proposed. Finally, the identification of NOTCH1 mutations in solid tumors and chronic lymphocytic leukemias has increased even further the clinical relevance of NOTCH signaling as a therapeutic target in human cancer. Here we review our current understanding of NOTCH1-induced transformation, the mechanisms of action of oncogenic NOTCH1 in T-ALL and the therapeutic and prognostic implications of NOTCH1 mutations in T-ALL.",

Many adult immature T-ALLs harbored mutations in myeloid-specific oncogenes and tumor suppressors including IDH1, IDH2, DNMT3A, FLT3, and NRAS. Moreover, we identified ETV6 mutations as a novel genetic lesion uniquely present in immature adult T-ALL. Our results demonstrate that early immature adult T-ALL represents a heterogeneous category of leukemias characterized by the presence of overlapping myeloid and T-ALL characteristics, and highlight the potential role of ETV6 mutations in these tumors.",

In 29% of cases, mutations and deletions inactivate the \u03b22-Microglobulin gene, thus preventing the cell-surface expression of the HLA class-I (HLA-I) complex that is necessary for recognition by CD8(+) cytotoxic T\u00a0cells. In 21% of cases, analogous lesions\u00a0involve the CD58 gene, which encodes a molecule involved in T and natural killer cell-mediated responses. In addition to gene inactivation, alternative mechanisms lead to aberrant expression of HLA-I and CD58 in >60% of DLBCL.

Nonetheless, they show distinct clinical presentations, suggesting that they may represent two different biological entities. To investigate the genetic characteristics of T-LBL and T-ALL, we used genomic and transcriptional profiling approaches. Genome-wide gene expression profiling, performed on 20 T-LBL and 10 T-ALL diagnostic specimens, revealed that the two malignancies shared a large fraction of their transcriptional profile while a subset of genes appeared to be differentially expressed in T-LBL versus T-ALL. This signature included genes involved in chemotactic responses and angiogenesis, which may play a role in tumor cell localization. Genome-wide copy number alteration analysis was performed on a subset of the samples analyzed by gene expression profiling and detected 41 recurrently altered genetic loci. Although most aberrations were found in both entities, several were selectively identified in T-LBL or T-ALL. In addition, NOTCH1 mutational status was found to correlate with a subset of genetic aberrations. Taken together, these results suggest that T-LBL and T-ALL are indeed two distinct diseases with unique transcriptional and genetic characteristics.",

Notably, p90 is crucial for Tip60-dependent p53 acetylation at Lys120, therefore facilitating activation of the proapoptotic targets.

    "abstract": "Germline mutations of the breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) gene are a major cause of familial breast and ovarian cancer. The BRCA1 protein displays E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and this enzymatic function is thought to be required for tumor suppression. To test this hypothesis, we generated mice that express an enzymatically defective Brca1. We found that this mutant Brca1 prevents tumor formation to the same degree as does wild-type Brca1 in three different genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models of cancer. In contrast, a mutation that ablates phosphoprotein recognition by the BRCA C terminus (BRCT) domains of BRCA1 elicits tumors in each of the three GEM models. Thus, BRCT phosphoprotein recognition, but not the E3 ligase activity, is required for BRCA1 tumor suppression.",

    "abstract": "Both p53 and Mdmx are ubiquitinated and degraded by the same E3 ligase Mdm2; interestingly, however, while p53 is rapidly degraded by Mdm2, Mdmx is a stable protein in most cancer cells. Thus, the mechanism by which Mdmx is degraded by Mdm2 needs further elucidation. Here, we identified the noncoding 5S rRNA as a major component of Mdmx-associated complexes from human cells. We show that 5S rRNA acts as a natural inhibitor of Mdmx degradation by Mdm2. RNAi-mediated knockdown of endogenous 5S rRNA, while not affecting p53 levels, significantly induces Mdmx degradation and, subsequently, activates p53-dependent growth arrest. Notably, 5S rRNA binds the RING domain of Mdmx and blocks its ubiquitination by Mdm2, whereas Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination remains intact. These results provide insights into the differential effects on p53 and Mdmx by Mdm2 in vivo and reveal a critical role for noncoding 5S rRNA in modulating the p53-Mdmx axis.",

    "abstract": "DNA double-strand break (DSB) resection, which results in RPA-bound single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), is activated in S phase by Cdk2. RPA-ssDNA activates the ATR-dependent checkpoint and homology-directed repair (HDR) via Rad51-dependent mechanisms. On the other hand, the fate of DSBs sustained during vertebrate M phase is largely unknown. We use cell-free Xenopus laevis egg extracts to examine the recruitment of proteins to chromatin after DSB formation. We find that S-phase extract recapitulates a two-step resection mechanism. M-phase chromosomes are also resected in cell-free extracts and cultured human cells. In contrast to the events in S phase, M-phase resection is solely dependent on MRN-CtIP. Despite generation of RPA-ssDNA, M-phase resection does not lead to ATR activation or Rad51 chromatin association. Remarkably, we find that Cdk1 permits resection by phosphorylation of CtIP but also prevents Rad51 binding to the resected ends. We have thus identified Cdk1 as a critical regulator of DSB repair in M phase. Cdk1 induces persistent ssDNA-RPA overhangs in M phase, thereby preventing both classical NHEJ and Rad51-dependent HDR.",

    "abstract": "The deubiquitinase HAUSP (herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease; also called USP7) has a critical role in regulating the p53-Mdm2 (murine double minute 2) pathway. By using the conventional knockout approach, we previously showed that hausp inactivation leads to early embryonic lethality. To fully understand the physiological functions of hausp, we have generated mice lacking hausp specifically in the brain and examined the impacts of this manipulation on brain development. We found that deletion of hausp in neural cells resulted in neonatal lethality. The brains from these mice displayed hypoplasia and deficiencies in development, which were mainly caused by p53-mediated apoptosis. Detailed analysis also showed an increase of both p53 levels and p53-dependent transcriptional activation in hausp knockout brains. Notably, neural cell survival and brain development of hausp-mutant mice can largely be restored in the p53-null background. Nevertheless, in contrast to the case of mdm2- and mdm4 (murine double minute 4)-mutant mice, inactivation of p53 failed to completely rescue the neonatal lethality of these hausp-mutant mice. These results indicate that HAUSP-mediated p53 regulation is crucial for brain development, and also suggest that both the p53-dependent and the p53-independent functions of HAUSP contribute to the neonatal lethality of hausp-mutant mice.",

The full spectrum of genetic lesions that are present in the CLL genome, and therefore the number and identity of dysregulated cellular pathways, have not been identified. By combining next-generation sequencing and copy number analysis, we show here that the typical CLL coding genome contains <20 clonally represented gene alterations/case, including predominantly nonsilent mutations, and fewer copy number aberrations. These analyses led to the discovery of several genes not previously known to be altered in CLL. Although most of these genes were affected at low frequency in an expanded CLL screening cohort, mutational activation of NOTCH1, observed in 8.3% of CLL at diagnosis, was detected at significantly higher frequency during disease progression toward Richter transformation (31.0%), as well as in chemorefractory CLL (20.8%). Consistent with the association of NOTCH1 mutations with clinically aggressive forms of the disease, NOTCH1 activation at CLL diagnosis emerged as an independent predictor of poor survival. These results provide initial data on the complexity of the CLL coding genome and identify a dysregulated pathway of diagnostic and therapeutic relevance.",

    "abstract": "AMPK has emerged as a critical mechanism for salutary effects of polyphenols on lipid metabolic disorders in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Here we demonstrate that AMPK interacts with and directly phosphorylates sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP-1c and -2). Ser372 phosphorylation of SREBP-1c by AMPK is necessary for inhibition of proteolytic processing and transcriptional activity of SREBP-1c in response to polyphenols and metformin. AMPK stimulates Ser372 phosphorylation, suppresses SREBP-1c cleavage and nuclear translocation, and represses SREBP-1c target gene expression in hepatocytes exposed to high glucose, leading to reduced lipogenesis and lipid accumulation. Hepatic activation of AMPK by the synthetic polyphenol S17834 protects against hepatic steatosis, hyperlipidemia, and accelerated atherosclerosis in diet-induced insulin-resistant LDL receptor-deficient mice in part through phosphorylation of SREBP-1c Ser372 and suppression of SREBP-1c- and -2-dependent lipogenesis. AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of SREBP may offer therapeutic strategies to combat insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and atherosclerosis.",

We report here that the two most common types--follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma--harbour frequent structural alterations inactivating CREBBP and, more rarely, EP300, two highly related histone and non-histone acetyltransferases (HATs) that act as transcriptional co-activators in multiple signalling pathways. Overall, about 39% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and 41% of follicular lymphoma cases display genomic deletions and/or somatic mutations that remove or inactivate the HAT coding domain of these two genes. These lesions usually affect one allele, suggesting that reduction in HAT dosage is important for lymphomagenesis. We demonstrate specific defects in acetylation-mediated inactivation of the BCL6 oncoprotein and activation of the p53 tumour suppressor. These results identify CREBBP/EP300 mutations as a major pathogenetic mechanism shared by common forms of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, with direct implications for the use of drugs targeting acetylation/deacetylation mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematologic tumor resulting from the malignant transformation of immature T-cell progenitors. Originally associated with a dismal prognosis, the outcome of T-ALL patients has improved remarkably over the last two decades as a result of the introduction of intensified chemotherapy protocols. However, these treatments are associated with significant acute and long-term toxicities, and the treatment of patients presenting with primary resistant disease or those relapsing after a transient response remains challenging. T-ALL is a genetically heterogeneous disease in which numerous chromosomal and genetic alterations cooperate to promote the aberrant proliferation and survival of leukemic lymphoblasts. However, the identification of activating mutations in the NOTCH1 gene in over 50% of T-ALL cases has come to define aberrant NOTCH signaling as a central player in this disease. Therefore, the NOTCH pathway represents an important potential therapeutic target. In this review, we will update our current understanding of the molecular basis of T-ALL, with a particular focus on the role of the NOTCH1 oncogene and the development of anti-NOTCH1 targeted therapies for the treatment of this disease.",

Genetic lesions in PHF6 found in AMLs are frameshift and nonsense mutations distributed through the gene or point mutations involving the second plant homeodomain (PHD)-like domain of the protein.

    "abstract": "Cell cycle checkpoints are involved in the coordinated response to DNA damage and thus play a key role in maintaining genome integrity. Several model systems have been developed to study the mechanisms and complexity of checkpoint function. Here we describe the application of cell-free extracts derived from Xenopus eggs as a model system to investigate DNA replication, damage, and checkpoint activation. We outline the preparation of cell-free extracts, DNA substrates and their subsequent use in assays aimed at understanding cell cycle checkpoints, and related processes. Several advances made over the years have enabled the continued use of the Xenopus system to answer a variety of questions in DNA replication, repair and checkpoint signaling. It is anticipated that the versatile Xenopus system is amenable to future modification as well to continue studies attempting to understand these important physiological processes.",

These phenotypic subtypes segregate with largely unique genetic lesions, suggesting the involvement of different pathogenetic mechanisms. In this report we show that the BLIMP1/PRDM1 gene is inactivated by multiple mechanisms, including homozygous deletions, truncating or missense mutations, and transcriptional repression by constitutively active BCL6, in \u223c53% of ABC-DLBCL. In vivo, conditional deletion of Blimp1 in mouse B cells promotes the development of lymphoproliferative disorders recapitulating critical features of the human ABC-DLBCL. These results demonstrate that BLIMP1 is a bona fide tumor-suppressor gene whose loss contributes to lymphomagenesis by blocking plasma cell differentiation.",

    "abstract": "The primary abnormality in Down syndrome (DS), trisomy 21, is well known; but how this chromosomal gain produces the complex DS phenotype, including immune system defects, is not well understood. We profiled DNA methylation in total peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) and T-lymphocytes from adults with DS and normal controls and found gene-specific abnormalities of CpG methylation in DS, with many of the differentially methylated genes having known or predicted roles in lymphocyte development and function. Validation of the microarray data by bisulfite sequencing and methylation-sensitive Pyrosequencing (MS-Pyroseq) confirmed strong differences in methylation (p<0.0001) for each of 8 genes tested: TMEM131, TCF7, CD3Z/CD247, SH3BP2, EIF4E, PLD6, SUMO3, and CPT1B, in DS versus control PBL. In addition, we validated differential methylation of NOD2/CARD15 by bisulfite sequencing in DS versus control T-cells. The differentially methylated genes were found on various autosomes, with no enrichment on chromosome 21. Differences in methylation were generally stable in a given individual, remained significant after adjusting for age, and were not due to altered cell counts. Some but not all of the differentially methylated genes showed different mean mRNA expression in DS versus control PBL; and the altered expression of 5 of these genes, TMEM131, TCF7, CD3Z, NOD2, and NPDC1, was recapitulated by exposing normal lymphocytes to the demethylating drug 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine (5aza-dC) plus mitogens. We conclude that altered gene-specific DNA methylation is a recurrent and functionally relevant downstream response to trisomy 21 in human cells.",

However, the specific mechanisms of T cell transformation downstream of TLX1 remain to be elucidated. Here we show that transgenic expression of human TLX1 in mice induces T-ALL with frequent deletions and mutations in Bcl11b (encoding B cell leukemia/lymphoma-11B) and identify the presence of recurrent mutations and deletions in BCL11B in 16% of human T-ALLs. Most notably, mouse TLX1 tumors were typically aneuploid and showed a marked defect in the activation of the mitotic checkpoint. Mechanistically, TLX1 directly downregulates the expression of CHEK1 (encoding CHK1 checkpoint homolog) and additional mitotic control genes and induces loss of the mitotic checkpoint in nontransformed preleukemic thymocytes. These results identify a previously unrecognized mechanism contributing to chromosomal missegregation and aneuploidy active at the earliest stages of tumor development in the pathogenesis of cancer.",

But these types of allelic asymmetries, along with allele-specific transcription factor binding (ASTF), have turned out to be far more pervasive-affecting many non-imprinted autosomal genes in normal human tissues. ASM, ASE and ASTF have now been mapped genome-wide by microarray-based methods and NextGen sequencing. Multiple studies agree that all three types of allelic asymmetries, as well as the related phenomena of expression and methylation quantitative trait loci, are mostly accounted for by cis-acting regulatory polymorphisms. The precise mechanisms by which this occurs are not yet understood, but there are some testable hypotheses and already a few direct clues. Future challenges include achieving higher resolution maps to locate the epicenters of cis-regulated ASM, using this information to test mechanistic models, and applying genome-wide maps of ASE/ASM/ASTF to pinpoint functional regulatory polymorphisms influencing disease susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited disease caused by mutations in at least 13 genes and characterized by genomic instability. In addition to displaying strikingly heterogenous clinical phenotypes, FA patients are exquisitely sensitive to treatments with crosslinking agents that create interstrand crosslinks (ICL). In contrast to bacteria and yeast, in which ICLs are repaired through replication-dependent and -independent mechanisms, it is thought that ICLs are repaired primarily during DNA replication in vertebrates. However, recent data indicate that replication-independent ICL repair also operates in vertebrates. While the precise role of the FA pathway in ICL repair remains elusive, increasing evidence suggests that FA proteins function at different steps in the sensing, recognition and processing of ICLs, as well as in signaling from these very toxic lesions, which can be generated by a wide variety of cancer chemotherapeutic drugs. Here, we discuss some of the recent findings that have shed light on the role of the FA pathway in ICL repair, with special emphasis on the implications of these findings for cancer therapy since disruption of FA genes have been associated with cancer predisposition.",

    "abstract": "Cervical cancer (CC) as a single diagnostic entity exhibits differences in clinical behavior and poor outcomes in response to therapy in advanced tumors. Although infection of high-risk human papillomavirus is recognized as an important initiating event in cervical tumorigenesis, stratification of CC into subclasses for progression and response to treatment remains elusive. Existing knowledge of genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional alterations is inadequate in addressing the issues of diagnosis, progression and response to treatment. Recent technological advances in high-throughput genomics and the application of integrative approaches have greatly accelerated gene discovery, facilitating the identification of molecular targets. In this article, we discuss the results obtained by preliminary integrative analysis of DNA copy number increases and gene expression, utilizing the two most common copy number-gained regions of 5p and 20q in identifying gene targets in CC. These analyses provide insights into the roles of genes such as RNASEN, POLS and SKP2 on 5p, KIF3B, RALY and E2F1 at 20q11.2 and CSE1L, ZNF313 and B4GALT5 at 20q13.13. Future integrative applications using additional datasets, such as mutations, DNA methylation and clinical outcomes, will raise the promise of accomplishing the identification of biological pathways and molecular targets for therapies for patients with CC.",

    "abstract": "Loss of function of DNA repair genes has been implicated in the development of many types of cancer. In the last several years, heterozygosity leading to haploinsufficiency for proteins involved in DNA repair was shown to play a role in genomic instability and carcinogenesis after DNA damage is induced, for example by ionizing radiation. Since the effect of heterozygosity for one gene is relatively small, we hypothesize that predisposition to cancer could be a result of the additive effect of heterozygosity for two or more genes critical to pathways that control DNA damage signaling, repair or apoptosis. We investigated the role of heterozygosity for                 Atm                ,                 Rad9                and                 Brca1                on cell oncogenic transformation and cell survival induced by 1GeV/n                 56                Fe ions. Our results show that cells heterozygous for both                 Atm                and                 Rad9                or                 Atm                and                 Brca1                have high survival rates and are more sensitive to transformation by high energy Iron ions when compared with wild-type controls or cells haploinsufficient for only one of these proteins. Since mutations or polymorphisms for similar genes exist in a small percentage of the human population, we have identified a radiosensitive sub-population. This finding has several implications. First, the existence of a radiosensitive sub-population may distort the shape of the dose-response relationship. Second, it would not be ethical to put exceptionally radiosensitive individuals into a setting where they may potentially be exposed to substantial doses of radiation.",

    "title": "Reactivating the ARF-p53 axis in AML cells by targeting ULF",
    "abstract": "The tumor suppressor ARF plays an essential role in the cellular response to oncogenic stress mainly through activation of p53. Nucleophosmin (NPM), a multifunctional protein, forms a stable protein complex with ARF in the nucleolus and protects ARF from the proteasome-mediated degradation. Notably, NPM is mutated in about one third of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients and these mutations lead to aberrant cytoplasmic dislocation of nucleophosmin (NPM-c). Cytoplasmic NPM mutants lose their abilities to retain ARF in the nucleolus and fail to stabilize ARF. Thus, activation of the ARF-p53 axis is significantly compromised in these AML cells. We have recently identified the ubiquitin ligase of ARF (ULF) as a key factor that controls ARF turnover in human cells. Here, we found that the steady levels of both ARF and p53 are very low in human acute myeloid leukaemia OCI-AML3 cells expressing cytoplamsic dislocated nucleophosmin (NPM-c). As expected, ARF is very unstable and rapidly degraded by proteasome. Nevertheless, ULF knockdown stabilizes ARF and reactivates p53 responses in these AML cells. These results further demonstrate that ULF is a bona fide E3 ligase for ARF and also suggest that ULF is an important target for activating the ARF-p53 axis in human AML cells.",

    "abstract": "Although the BRCA1 tumor suppressor has been implicated in many cellular processes, the biochemical mechanisms by which it influences these diverse pathways are poorly understood. The only known enzymatic function of BRCA1 is the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity mediated by its highly conserved RING domain. In vivo, BRCA1 associates with the BARD1 polypeptide to form a heterodimeric BRCA1/BARD1 complex that catalyzes autoubiquitination of BRCA1 and trans ubiquitination of other protein substrates. In most cases, BRCA1-dependent ubiquitination generates polyubiquitin chains bearing an unconventional K6 linkage that does not appear to target proteins for proteasomal degradation. Since ubiquitin-dependent processes are usually mediated by cellular receptors with ubiquitin-binding motifs, we screened for proteins that specifically bind autoubiquitinated BRCA1. Here we report that the UBXN1 polypeptide, which contains a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) motif, recognizes autoubiquitinated BRCA1. This occurs through a bipartite interaction in which the UBA domain of UBXN1 binds K6-linked polyubiquitin chains conjugated to BRCA1 while the C-terminal sequences of UBXN1 bind the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer in a ubiquitin-independent fashion. Significantly, the E3 ligase activity of BRCA1/BARD1 is dramatically reduced in the presence of UBXN1, suggesting that UBXN1 regulates the enzymatic function of BRCA1 in a manner that is dependent on its ubiquitination status.",

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy with an increased incidence in males. In this study, we report the identification of inactivating mutations and deletions in the X-linked plant homeodomain finger 6 (PHF6) gene in 16% of pediatric and 38% of adult primary T-ALL samples. Notably, PHF6 mutations are almost exclusively found in T-ALL samples from male subjects. Mutational loss of PHF6 is importantly associated with leukemias driven by aberrant expression of the homeobox transcription factor oncogenes TLX1 and TLX3. Overall, these results identify PHF6 as a new X-linked tumor suppressor in T-ALL and point to a strong genetic interaction between PHF6 loss and aberrant expression of TLX transcription factors in the pathogenesis of this disease.",

    "abstract": "We have generated a knockout mouse strain in which the gene coding for the ubiquitin ligase Huwe1 has been inactivated in cerebellar granule neuron precursors (CGNPs) and radial glia. These mice have a high rate of postnatal lethality and profound cerebellar abnormalities. The external granule layer of the cerebellum, which contains CGNPs, is expanded and displays aberrant proliferation and impaired differentiation of the progenitor cell population. The uncontrolled proliferation of the CGNPs is associated with accumulation of the N-Myc oncoprotein, a substrate of Huwe1, and con-sequent activation of the signaling events downstream to N-Myc. Furthermore, loss of Huwe1 in Bergmann glia leads to extensive disorganization of this cell population with layering aberrations, severe granule neuron migration defects, and persistence of ectopic clusters of granule neurons in the external granule layer. Our findings uncover an unexpected role for Huwe1 in regulating Berg-mann glia differentiation and indicate that this ubiquitin ligase orchestrates the programming of the neural progenitors that give rise to neurons and glia in the cerebellum.",

    "title": "Transcription-independent ARF regulation in oncogenic stress-mediated p53 responses",
    "abstract": "The tumour suppressor ARF is specifically required for p53 activation under oncogenic stress. Recent studies showed that p53 activation mediated by ARF, but not that induced by DNA damage, acts as a major protection against tumorigenesis in vivo under certain biological settings, suggesting that the ARF-p53 axis has more fundamental functions in tumour suppression than originally thought. Because ARF is a very stable protein in most human cell lines, it has been widely assumed that ARF induction is mediated mainly at the transcriptional level and that activation of the ARF-p53 pathway by oncogenes is a much slower and largely irreversible process by comparison with p53 activation after DNA damage. Here we report that ARF is very unstable in normal human cells but that its degradation is inhibited in cancerous cells. Through biochemical purification, we identified a specific ubiquitin ligase for ARF and named it ULF. ULF interacts with ARF both in vitro and in vivo and promotes the lysine-independent ubiquitylation and degradation of ARF. ULF knockdown stabilizes ARF in normal human cells, triggering ARF-dependent, p53-mediated growth arrest. Moreover, nucleophosmin (NPM) and c-Myc, both of which are commonly overexpressed in cancer cells, are capable of abrogating ULF-mediated ARF ubiquitylation through distinct mechanisms, and thereby promote ARF stabilization in cancer cells. These findings reveal the dynamic feature of the ARF-p53 pathway and suggest that transcription-independent mechanisms are critically involved in ARF regulation during responses to oncogenic stress.",

    "abstract": "Hausp is a deubiquitinase that has been shown to regulate the p53-Mdm2 pathway. Cotransfection of p53 and Hausp stabilizes p53 through the removal of ubiquitin moieties from polyubiquitinated p53. Interestingly, knockout or RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Hausp in human cells also resulted in the stabilization of p53 due to the destabilization of Mdm2, suggesting a dynamic role of Hausp in p53 activation. To understand the physiological functions of Hausp, we generated hausp knockout mice. Hausp knockout mice die during early embryonic development between embryonic days E6.5 and E7.5. The hausp knockout embryos showed p53 activation, but no apparent increase in apoptosis. Embryonic lethality was caused by a dramatic reduction in proliferation and termination in development, in part due to p53 activation and/or abrogation of p53-independent functions. Although deletion of p53 did not completely rescue the embryonic lethality of the hausp knockout, embryonic development was extended in both hausp and p53 double knockout embryos. These data show that Hausp has a critical role in regulating the p53-Mdm2 pathway.",

ASM has long been studied as a hallmark of imprinted genes, and a chromosome-wide version of this phenomenon occurs, in a random fashion, during X chromosome inactivation in female cells. But the type of ASM motivating the study by Schalkwyk et al. is different. They used a high-resolution, methylation-sensitive SNP array (MSNP) method for genome-wide profiling of ASM in total peripheral-blood leukocytes (PBL) and buccal cells from a series of monozygotic twin pairs. Their data bring a new level of detail to our knowledge of a newly recognized phenomenon-nonimprinted, sequence-dependent ASM. They document the widespread occurrence of this phenomenon among human genes and discuss its basic implications for gene regulation and genetic-epigenetic interactions. But this paper and recent work from other laboratories(2,3) raises the possibility of a more immediate and practical application for ASM mapping, namely to help extract maximum information from genome-wide association studies.",

BCL6's physiologic function is only partially known because the complete set of its targets in GC B cells has not been identified. To address this issue, we used an integrated biochemical-computational-functional approach to identify BCL6 direct targets in normal GC B cells. This approach includes (1) identification of BCL6-bound promoters by genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation, (2) inference of transcriptional relationships by the use of a regulatory network reverse engineering approach (ARACNe), and (3) validation of physiologic relevance of the candidate targets down-regulated in GC B cells. Our approach demonstrated that a large set of promoters (> 4000) is physically bound by BCL6 but that only a fraction of them is repressed in GC B cells. This set of 1207 targets identifies several cellular functions directly controlled by BCL6 during GC development, including activation, survival, DNA-damage response, cell cycle arrest, cytokine signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling, and differentiation. These results define a broad role of BCL6 in preventing centroblasts from responding to signals leading to exit from the GC before they complete the phase of proliferative expansion and of antibody affinity maturation.",

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are one of the most abundant cell types in the tumor stroma, and these cells are pro-tumorigenic. Evidence that CAFs are epigenetically and possibly also genetically distinct from normal fibroblasts is beginning to define these cells as potential targets of anti-cancer therapy. Here, we review the cell-of-origin and molecular biology of CAFs, arguing that such knowledge provides a rational basis for designing therapeutic strategies to coordinately and synergistically target both the stromal and malignant epithelial component of human cancers.",

    "abstract": "The inference of transcriptional networks that regulate transitions into physiological or pathological cellular states remains a central challenge in systems biology. A mesenchymal phenotype is the hallmark of tumour aggressiveness in human malignant glioma, but the regulatory programs responsible for implementing the associated molecular signature are largely unknown. Here we show that reverse-engineering and an unbiased interrogation of a glioma-specific regulatory network reveal the transcriptional module that activates expression of mesenchymal genes in malignant glioma. Two transcription factors (C/EBPbeta and STAT3) emerge as synergistic initiators and master regulators of mesenchymal transformation. Ectopic co-expression of C/EBPbeta and STAT3 reprograms neural stem cells along the aberrant mesenchymal lineage, whereas elimination of the two factors in glioma cells leads to collapse of the mesenchymal signature and reduces tumour aggressiveness. In human glioma, expression of C/EBPbeta and STAT3 correlates with mesenchymal differentiation and predicts poor clinical outcome. These results show that the activation of a small regulatory module is necessary and sufficient to initiate and maintain an aberrant phenotypic state in cancer cells.",

Here, we demonstrate that deletion in mice of the 13q14-minimal deleted region (MDR), which encodes the DLEU2/miR-15a/16-1 cluster, causes development of indolent B cell-autonomous, clonal lymphoproliferative disorders, recapitulating the spectrum of CLL-associated phenotypes observed in humans. miR-15a/16-1-deletion accelerates the proliferation of both human and mouse B cells by modulating the expression of genes controlling cell-cycle progression.

BCL6 is also a frequently activated oncogene in the pathogenesis of human B cell lymphomas, most of which derive from the GC B cells. A thorough understanding of the biological role of BCL6 in normal B cell development and lymphomagenesis depends upon the identification of the full set of genes that are targets of its transcriptional regulatory function. Recently, the identification of BCL6 targets has been implemented with the use of genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and gene expression profiling approaches. A large set of promoters have been shown to be physically bound by BCL6, but only a fraction of them appears to be subjected to transcriptional repression in GC B cells. This set of BCL6 targets points to a number of cellular functions which are likely to be directly controlled by BCL6 during GC development, including activation, survival, DNA-damage response, cell cycle arrest, cytokine-, toll-like receptor-, TGFbeta-, WNT-signaling, and differentiation. Overall, BCL6 is revealing its dual role of \"safe-keeper\" in preventing centroblasts from responding to signals leading to a premature exit from the GC and of contributor to lymphomagenesis by allowing the instauration of conditions favorable to malignant transformation.",

It is well accepted that ubiquitination plays a major part in p53 regulation. Nonetheless, the molecular mechanisms by which p53 activity is controlled by ubiquitination are complex. Mdm2, a RING oncoprotein, was once thought to be the sole E3 ubiquitin ligase for p53, however recent studies have shown that p53 is stabilized but still degraded in the cells of Mdm2-null mice. Although the essential role of Mdm2 in p53 regulation is well established, there are an increasing number of other E3 ligases implicated in Mdm2-independent regulation of p53 by ubiquitination. The different types of ubiquitination on p53 by various E3 ligases have been linked to its differential effects on p53-mediated stress responses. In addition to proteasome-mediated degradation, ubiquitination of p53 acts as signals for degradation-independent functions, such as nuclear export. The function of ubiquitinated p53 varies in the nucleus and cytosol underlying the many potential contributions ubiquitinated p53 may have in promoting cell proliferation or death. Thus, p53 requires multiple layers of regulatory control to ensure correct temporal and spatial functions.",

We show binding of TRF2 to telomeric DNA, indicating that exogenous DNA exclusively composed of telomeric repeats is recognized by shelterin components. Interaction with telomere binding proteins is not sufficient to prevent a DNA damage response. Notably, we observe regulated assembly of the pre-replicative complex proteins ORC2, MCM6 and Cdc6 to telomeric DNA. Most importantly, we detect origin-dependent replication of telomeric substrates under conditions that inhibit checkpoint activation. These results indicate that pre-replicative complexes assemble within telomeric DNA and can be converted into functional origins.",

Tumor formation was preceded by increases in GC B cells and CD69(+) T cells, as well as an increased formation of spontaneous GCs, suggesting that S1P(2) loss may promote lymphomagenesis in part by disrupting GC B-cells homeostasis. With the sole exception of rare lung tumors, the effect of S1P(2) gene disruption is remarkably restricted to DLBCL. In humans, 28 of 106 (26%) DLBCL samples were found to harbor multiple somatic mutations in the 5' sequences of the S1P(2) gene. Mutations displayed features resembling those generated by the IgV-associated somatic hypermutation mechanism, but were not detected at significant levels in normal GC B cells, indicating a tumor-associated aberrant function. Collectively, our data suggest that S1P(2) signaling may play a critical role in suppressing DLBCL formation in vivo. The high incidence of DLBCL in S1P(2)(-/-) mice, its onset at old age, and the relative lack of other neoplasms identify these mice as a novel, and potentially valuable, model for this highly prevalent and aggressive human malignancy.",

    "abstract": "The cyclin D1 proto-oncoprotein is a crucial regulator in cell-cycle progression, and aberrant overexpression of cyclin D1 is linked to tumorigenesis of many different cancer types. By screening ubiquitinated cyclin D1 as a substrate with a deubiquitinase library, we have identified USP2 as a specific deubiquitinase for cyclin D1. USP2 directly interacts with cyclin D1 and promotes its stabilization by antagonizing ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Conversely, USP2 knockdown destabilizes cyclin D1 and induces growth arrest in the human cancer lines where cell growth is dependent on cyclin D1 expression. Of note, cyclin D1 is not universally required for cell-cycle progression. Inactivation of USP2 has either very mild effects on cell growth in normal human fibroblasts or no effect in the cancer cells that do not express cyclin D1. These findings suggest that targeting USP2 is an effective approach to induce growth suppression in the cancer cells addicted to cyclin D1 expression.",

Here, we show that phosphorylation of Mre11 at SQ/TQ motifs by PIKKs (PI3 Kinase-related Kinases) induces MRN (Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1) complex dissociation from chromatin by reducing Mre11 affinity for DNA. Whereas phosphorylation of Mre11 at these residues is not required for DSB-induced ATM (Ataxia-Telangiectasia mutated) activation, abrogation of Mre11 dephosphorylation impairs ATM signaling. Our study provides a functional characterization of the DNA damage-induced Mre11 phosphorylation, and suggests that MRN inactivation participates in the down-regulation of damage signaling during checkpoint recovery following DSB repair.",

    "abstract": "DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are the most toxic lesions induced by chemotherapeutic agents such as mitomycin C and cisplatin. By covalently linking both DNA strands, ICLs prevent DNA melting, transcription, and replication. Studies on ICL signaling and repair have been limited, because these drugs generate additional DNA lesions that trigger checkpoint signaling. Here, we monitor sensing, signaling from, and repairing of a single site-specific ICL in cell-free extract derived from Xenopus eggs and in mammalian cells. Notably, we demonstrate that ICLs trigger a checkpoint response independently of origin-initiated DNA replication and uncoupling of DNA polymerase and DNA helicase. The Fanconi anemia pathway acts upstream of RPA-ATR-Chk1 to generate the ICL signal. The system also repairs ICLs in a reaction that involves extensive, error-free DNA synthesis. Repair occurs by both origin-dependent and origin-independent mechanisms. Our data suggest that cell sensitivity to crosslinking agents results from both checkpoint and DNA repair defects.",

We identified phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate RAC exchanger 2a (P-REX2a) as a PTEN-interacting protein. P-REX2a mRNA was more abundant in human cancer cells and significantly increased in tumors with wild-type PTEN that expressed an activated mutant of PIK3CA encoding the p110 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase subunit alpha (PI3Kalpha). P-REX2a inhibited PTEN lipid phosphatase activity and stimulated the PI3K pathway only in the presence of PTEN. P-REX2a stimulated cell growth and cooperated with a PIK3CA mutant to promote growth factor-independent proliferation and transformation. Depletion of P-REX2a reduced amounts of phosphorylated AKT and growth in human cell lines with intact PTEN. Thus, P-REX2a is a component of the PI3K pathway that can antagonize PTEN in cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Lesions of ERBB2, PTEN, and PIK3CA activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway during cancer development by increasing levels of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP(3)). 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) is the first node of the PI3K signal output and is required for activation of AKT. PIP(3) recruits PDK1 and AKT to the cell membrane through interactions with their pleckstrin homology domains, allowing PDK1 to activate AKT by phosphorylating it at residue threonine-308. We show that total PDK1 protein and mRNA were overexpressed in a majority of human breast cancers and that 21% of tumors had five or more copies of the gene encoding PDK1, PDPK1. We found that increased PDPK1 copy number was associated with upstream pathway lesions (ERBB2 amplification, PTEN loss, or PIK3CA mutation), as well as patient survival. Examination of an independent set of breast cancers and tumor cell lines derived from multiple forms of human cancers also found increased PDK1 protein levels associated with such upstream pathway lesions. In human mammary cells, PDK1 enhanced the ability of upstream lesions to signal to AKT, stimulate cell growth and migration, and rendered cells more resistant to PDK1 and PI3K inhibition. After orthotopic transplantation, PDK1 overexpression was not oncogenic but dramatically enhanced the ability of ERBB2 to form tumors. Our studies argue that PDK1 overexpression and increased PDPK1 copy number are common occurrences in cancer that potentiate the oncogenic effect of upstream lesions on the PI3K pathway. Therefore, we conclude that alteration of PDK1 is a critical component of oncogenic PI3K signaling in breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Self-renewal and proliferation of neural stem cells and the decision to initiate neurogenesis are crucial events directing brain development. Here we show that the ubiquitin ligase Huwe1 operates upstream of the N-Myc-DLL3-Notch pathway to control neural stem cell activity and promote neurogenesis. Conditional inactivation of the Huwe1 gene in the mouse brain caused neonatal lethality associated with disorganization of the laminar patterning of the cortex. These defects stemmed from severe impairment of neurogenesis associated with uncontrolled expansion of the neural stem cell compartment. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments in the mouse cortex demonstrated that Huwe1 restrains proliferation and enables neuronal differentiation by suppressing the N-Myc-DLL3 cascade. Notably, human high-grade gliomas carry focal hemizygous deletions of the X-linked Huwe1 gene in association with amplification of the N-myc locus. Our results indicate that Huwe1 balances proliferation and neurogenesis in the developing brain and that this pathway is subverted in malignant brain tumors.",

Inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling in glucocorticoid-resistant T-ALL restored glucocorticoid sensitivity and co-treatment with glucocorticoids inhibited GSI-induced gut toxicity. Thus, combination therapies with GSIs plus glucocorticoids may offer a new opportunity for the use of anti-NOTCH1 therapies in human T-ALL.",

We used single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis to analyze paired diagnostic and relapsed T-ALL samples to identify recurrent genetic alterations in T-ALL. This analysis showed that diagnosis and relapsed cases have common genetic alterations, but also that relapsed samples frequently lose chromosomal markers present at diagnosis, suggesting that relapsed T-ALL emerges from an ancestral clone different from the major leukemic population at diagnosis. In addition, we identified deletions and associated mutations in the WT1 tumor suppressor gene in 2 of 9 samples. Subsequent analysis showed WT1 mutations in 28 of 211 (13.2%) of pediatric and 10 of 85 (11.7%) of adult T-ALL cases. WT1 mutations present in T-ALL are predominantly heterozygous frameshift mutations resulting in truncation of the C-terminal zinc finger domains of this transcription factor. WT1 mutations are most prominently found in T-ALL cases with aberrant rearrangements of the oncogenic TLX1, TLX3, and HOXA transcription factor oncogenes. Survival analysis demonstrated that WT1 mutations do not confer adverse prognosis in pediatric and adult T-ALL. Overall, these results identify the presence of WT1 mutations as a recurrent genetic alteration in T-ALL.",

The biological function of BCL6 is only partially understood because no more than a few genes have been functionally characterized as direct targets of BCL6 transrepression activity. Here we report that the anti-apoptotic proto-oncogene BCL2 is a direct target of BCL6 in GC B cells. BCL6 binds to the BCL2 promoter region by interacting with the transcriptional activator Miz1 and suppresses Miz1-induced activation of BCL2 expression. BCL6-mediated suppression of BCL2 is lost in FL and DLBCL, where the 2 proteins are pathologically coexpressed, because of BCL2 chromosomal translocations and other mechanisms, including Miz1 deregulation and somatic mutations in the BCL2 promoter region. These results identify an important function for BCL6 in facilitating apoptosis of GC B cells via suppression of BCL2, and suggest that blocking this pathway is critical for lymphomagenesis.",

    "title": "Mutations of multiple genes cause deregulation of NF-kappaB in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma",
    "abstract": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common form of lymphoma in adulthood, comprises multiple biologically and clinically distinct subtypes including germinal centre B-cell-like (GCB) and activated B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCL. Gene expression profile studies have shown that its most aggressive subtype, ABC-DLBCL, is associated with constitutive activation of the NF-kappaB transcription complex. However, except for a small fraction of cases, it remains unclear whether NF-kappaB activation in these tumours represents an intrinsic program of the tumour cell of origin or a pathogenetic event. Here we show that >50% of ABC-DLBCL and a smaller fraction of GCB-DLBCL carry somatic mutations in multiple genes, including negative (TNFAIP3, also called A20) and positive (CARD11, TRAF2, TRAF5, MAP3K7 (TAK1) and TNFRSF11A (RANK)) regulators of NF-kappaB. Of these, the A20 gene, which encodes a ubiquitin-modifying enzyme involved in termination of NF-kappaB responses, is most commonly affected, with approximately 30% of patients displaying biallelic inactivation by mutations and/or deletions. When reintroduced in cell lines carrying biallelic inactivation of the gene, A20 induced apoptosis and cell growth arrest, indicating a tumour suppressor role. Less frequently, missense mutations of TRAF2 and CARD11 produce molecules with significantly enhanced ability to activate NF-kappaB. Thus, our results demonstrate that NF-kappaB activation in DLBCL is caused by genetic lesions affecting multiple genes, the loss or activation of which may promote lymphomagenesis by leading to abnormally prolonged NF-kappaB responses.",

    "abstract": "The traditional view of p53 activation includes three steps-p53 stabilization, DNA binding, and transcriptional activation. However, recent studies indicate that each step of p53 activation is more complex than originally anticipated. Moreover, both genetic studies in mice and in vitro studies with purified components suggest that the classical model may not be sufficient to explain all aspects of p53 activation in vivo. To reconcile these differences, we propose that antirepression, the release of p53 from repression by factors such as Mdm2 and MdmX, is a key step in the physiological activation of p53.",

    "abstract": "Unique and shared cytogenetic abnormalities have been documented for marginal zone lymphomas (MZLs) arising at different sites. Recently, homozygous deletions of the chromosomal band 6q23, involving the tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3, A20) gene, a negative regulator of NF-kappaB, were described in ocular adnexal MZL, suggesting a role for A20 as a tumor suppressor in this disease. Here, we investigated inactivation of A20 by DNA mutations or deletions in a panel of extranodal MZL (EMZL), nodal MZL (NMZL), and splenic MZL (SMZL). Inactivating mutations encoding truncated A20 proteins were identified in 6 (19%) of 32 MZLs, including 2 (18%) of 11 EMZLs, 3 (33%) of 9 NMZLs, and 1 (8%) of 12 SMZLs. Two additional unmutated nonsplenic MZLs also showed monoallelic or biallelic A20 deletions by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or SNP-arrays. Thus, A20 inactivation by either somatic mutation and/or deletion represents a common genetic aberration across all MZL subtypes, which may contribute to lymphomagenesis by inducing constitutive NF-kappaB activation.",

Here we discuss the current understanding of how SIRT1 functions in light of recent discoveries and propose that the net outcome of the seemingly opposite oncogenic and tumour-suppressive effects of SIRT1 depends on the status of p53.",

Previous studies by us and others demonstrated that Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination induces both degradation and cytoplasmic localization. Here we describe MSL2, a novel E3 ligase for p53 that promotes ubiquitin-dependent cytoplasmic p53 localization. Unlike Mdm2 or most other p53 E3 ligases, MSL2-mediated p53 ubiquitination does not affect the stability of p53. Moreover, the MSL2-mediated effect on p53 is Mdm2-independent.

    "abstract": "Mutations in the phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN)/phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-alpha (PI3K) signaling pathway are frequently found in human cancer. In addition, Pten(+/-) mice develop tumors in multiple organs because of the activation of the PI3K signaling cascade. Because activation of PI3K signaling leads to feedback inhibition of insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS2) expression, an upstream activator of PI3K, we therefore anticipated that IRS2 expression would be low in tumors that lack PTEN. Surprisingly, however, an elevation of IRS2 was often detected in tumor samples in which PTEN levels were compromised. To determine the potential contribution of Irs2 to tumor progression, Pten(+/-) mice were crossed with Irs2(+/-) mice. Deletion of Irs2 did not affect the initiation of neoplasia found in Pten(+/-) mice but suppressed cancer cell growth, proliferation, and invasion through the basement membrane. Deletion of Irs2 also attenuated the expression of Myc in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in Pten(+/-) mice. In addition, the expression levels of IRS2 and MYC were highly correlated in human prostate cancer, and IRS2 could stimulate MYC expression in cultured cells. Our findings provide evidence that the PI3K-activating adaptor Irs2 contributes to tumor progression in Pten(+/-) mice by stimulating both Myc and DNA synthesis.",

Small-molecule gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), which block a critical proteolytic step required for NOTCH1 activation, can effectively block the activity of NOTCH1 mutant alleles. However, the clinical development of GSIs has been hampered by their low cytotoxicity against human T-ALL and the development of significant gastrointestinal toxicity derived from the inhibition of NOTCH signaling in the gut. Improved understanding of the oncogenic mechanisms of NOTCH1 and the effects of NOTCH inhibition in leukemic cells and the intestinal epithelium are required for the design of effective anti-NOTCH1 therapies in T-ALL.",

However, limited antileukemic cytotoxicity and severe gastrointestinal toxicity have restricted the clinical application of these targeted drugs. Here we show that combination therapy with GSIs plus glucocorticoids can improve the antileukemic effects of GSIs and reduce their gut toxicity in vivo. Inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling in glucocorticoid-resistant T-ALL restored glucocorticoid receptor autoupregulation and induced apoptotic cell death through induction of the gene encoding BCL-2-like apoptosis initiator-11 (BCL2L11). GSI treatment resulted in cell cycle arrest and accumulation of goblet cells in the gut mediated by upregulation of the gene encoding the transcription factor Kr\u00fcppel-like factor-4 (Klf4), a negative regulator of the cell cycle required for goblet cell differentiation. In contrast, glucocorticoid treatment induced transcriptional upregulation of cyclin D2 (Ccnd2) and protected mice from developing the intestinal goblet cell metaplasia typically induced by inhibition of NOTCH signaling with GSIs. These results support a role for glucocorticoids plus GSIs in the treatment of glucocorticoid-resistant T-ALL.",

    "abstract": "Hereditary cases of breast and ovarian cancer are often attributed to germ-line mutations of the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene. Although BRCA1 is involved in diverse cellular processes, its role in the maintenance of genomic integrity may be a key component of its tumor suppression activity. The protein encoded by BRCA1 interacts in vivo with the related BARD1 protein to form a heterodimeric complex that acts as a ubiquitin E3 ligase. Because the enzymatic activity of the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer is conserved over a broad phylogenetic range, it is thought to be critical for the central functions of BRCA1. To test this hypothesis, we have generated isogenic clones of embryonic stem cells that do or do not express an enzymatically proficient Brca1 polypeptide. Surprisingly, cells lacking the ubiquitin ligase activity of BRCA1 are viable and do not accumulate spontaneous cytogenetic rearrangements. Gene targeting efficiencies are modestly reduced in these cells, and chromosomal rearrangements arise at elevated rates in response to genotoxic stress. Nonetheless, cells lacking Brca1 enzymatic activity are not hypersensitive to the DNA cross-linking agent mitomycin C. They also form Rad51 focus in response to ionizing radiation and repair chromosome breaks by homologous recombination at wild-type levels. These results indicate that key aspects of BRCA1 function in genome maintenance, including its role in homology-directed repair of double-strand DNA breaks, do not depend on the E3 ligase activity of BRCA1.",

Here we show evidence for this same type of epigenetic alteration in cancer-associated stromal myofibroblasts. We used methylation-sensitive SNP array analysis (MSNP) to profile DNA methylation in early-passage cultures of stromal myofibroblasts isolated from human gastric cancers. The MSNP data indicated widespread hypomethylation in these cells, with rare focal gains of methylation, conclusions that were independently validated by bisulfite sequencing and by a methylation-sensitive cytosine incorporation assay. Immunohistochemistry with anti-5-methylcytosine (anti-5-methyl-C) in a series of gastrectomy specimens showed frequent loss of methylation in nuclei of both the malignant epithelial cells and alpha-smooth muscle actin (ASMA)-positive stromal myofibroblasts of both intestinal-type and diffuse carcinomas. We confirmed this phenomenon and established its onset at the stage of noninvasive dysplastic lesions by immunohistochemistry for anti-5-methyl-C in a transgenic mouse model of multistage gastric carcinogenesis. These findings indicate similar general classes of epigenetic alterations in carcinoma cells and their accompanying reactive stromal cells and add to accumulating evidence for biological differences between normal and cancer-associated myofibroblasts.",

FANCD2 and the FA core complex bind to chromatin during DNA replication; however, the role of FA proteins during replication is unknown. Using Xenopus cell-free extracts, we show that FANCL depletion results in defective DNA replication restart following treatment with camptothecin, a drug that results in DSBs during DNA replication. This defect is more pronounced following treatment with mitomycin C, presumably because of an additional role of the FA pathway in DNA crosslink repair. Moreover, we show that chromatin binding of FA core complex proteins during DNA replication follows origin assembly and origin firing and is dependent on the binding of RPA to ssDNA while FANCD2 additionally requires ATR, consistent with FA proteins acting at replication forks. Together, our data suggest that FA proteins play a role in replication restart at collapsed replication forks.",

    "abstract": "Rearrangements initiating within the well-characterized break-point cluster region of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene on 11q23 are a hallmark of therapy-related leukemias following treatment with topoisomerase II poisons including etoposide. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are believed to be the target cell for leukemia-initiating MLL rearrangement events. Although etoposide treatment is sufficient to induce readily detectable MLL rearrangements in primary human CD34+ cells, the majority of cells that gain translocations do not proliferate in culture possibly due to reduced proliferative capacity of most CD34+ cells during normal differentiation [Blood 2005;105:2124]. We characterized the impact of etoposide on primary human long-term repopulating HSC that represent only a minor portion of CD34+ cells. The proliferative capacity of HSC is dramatically increased following both a single and multiple exposures to etoposide as determined by their ability to engraft bone marrow of immune-deficient non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice and to initiate hematopoiesis in long-term initiating cultures. Similar to results in CD34+ cells, a significant proportion of etoposide-treated HSC-derived clones harbored stable MLL rearrangements, including duplications, inversions and translocations. These results indicate HSC are highly susceptible to etoposide-induced and potentially oncogenic rearrangements initiating within MLL, and these HSC are particularly proficient for continued long-term proliferation both in vivo and in vitro.",

    "abstract": "Carcinoma is an altered state of tissue differentiation in which epithelial cells no longer respond to cues that keep them in their proper position. A break down in these cues has disastrous consequences not only in cancer but also in embryonic development when cells of various lineages must organize into discrete entities to form a body plan. Paraxial protocadherin (PAPC) is an adhesion protein with six cadherin repeats that organizes the formation and polarity of developing cellular structures in frog, fish and mouse embryos. Here we show that protocadherin-8 (PCDH8), the human ortholog of PAPC, is inactivated through either mutation or epigenetic silencing in a high fraction of breast carcinomas. Loss of PCDH8 expression is associated with loss of heterozygosity, partial promoter methylation, and increased proliferation. Complementation of mutant tumor cell line HCC2218 with wild-type PCDH8 inhibited its growth. Two tumor mutants, E146K and R343H, were defective for inhibition of cell growth and migration. Surprisingly, the E146K mutant transformed the human mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A and sustained the expression of cyclin D1 and MYC without epidermal growth factor. We propose that loss of PCDH8 promotes oncogenesis in epithelial human cancers by disrupting cell-cell communication dedicated to tissue organization and repression of mitogenic signaling.",

Using methylation-sensitive SNP analysis (MSNP), we surveyed the human genome at 50K and 250K resolution, identifying ASM as recurrent genotype call conversions from heterozygosity to homozygosity when genomic DNAs were predigested with the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme HpaII. Using independent assays, we confirmed ASM at 16 SNP-tagged loci distributed across various chromosomes. At 12 of these loci (75%), the ASM tracked strongly with the sequence of adjacent SNPs. Further analysis showed allele-specific mRNA expression at two loci from this methylation-based screen--the vanin and CYP2A6-CYP2A7 gene clusters--both implicated in traits of medical importance. This recurrent phenomenon of sequence-dependent ASM has practical implications for mapping and interpreting associations of noncoding SNPs and haplotypes with human phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Development of the nervous system requires that timely withdrawal from the cell cycle be coupled with initiation of differentiation. Ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the N-Myc oncoprotein in neural stem/progenitor cells is thought to trigger the arrest of proliferation and begin differentiation. Here we report that the HECT-domain ubiquitin ligase Huwe1 ubiquitinates the N-Myc oncoprotein through Lys 48-mediated linkages and targets it for destruction by the proteasome. This process is physiologically implemented by embryonic stem (ES) cells differentiating along the neuronal lineage and in the mouse brain during development. Genetic and RNA interference-mediated inactivation of the Huwe1 gene impedes N-Myc degradation, prevents exit from the cell cycle by opposing the expression of Cdk inhibitors and blocks differentiation through persistent inhibition of early and late markers of neuronal differentiation. Silencing of N-myc in cells lacking Huwe1 restores neural differentiation of ES cells and rescues cell-cycle exit and differentiation of the mouse cortex, demonstrating that Huwe1 restrains proliferation and enables neuronal differentiation by mediating the degradation of N-Myc. These findings indicate that Huwe1 links destruction of N-Myc to the quiescent state that complements differentiation in the neural tissue.",

    "abstract": "The activation of the tumor suppressor p53 facilitates the cellular response to genotoxic stress; however, the p53 response can only be executed if its interaction with its inhibitor Mdm2 is abolished. There have been conflicting reports on the question of whether p53 posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation or acetylation, are essential or only play a subtle, fine-tuning role in the p53 response. Thus, it remains unclear whether p53 modification is absolutely required for its activation. We have now identified all major acetylation sites of p53. Although unacetylated p53 retains its ability to induce the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop, loss of acetylation completely abolishes p53-dependent growth arrest and apoptosis. Notably, acetylation of p53 abrogates Mdm2-mediated repression by blocking the recruitment of Mdm2 to p53-responsive promoters, which leads to p53 activation independent of its phosphorylation status. Our study identifies p53 acetylation as an indispensable event that destabilizes the p53-Mdm2 interaction and enables the p53-mediated stress response.",

    "abstract": "Women with germ-line mutations of the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene are highly susceptible to breast and ovarian cancer. The protein product of BRCA1 is involved in a broad spectrum of biological processes and interacts with many diverse proteins. One of these, BARD1, associates with BRCA1 to form a heterodimeric complex that is enzymatically active as an ubiquitin E3 ligase. Although the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer has been implicated in several aspects of BRCA1 function, its role in tumor suppression has not been evaluated. To address this question, we generated mouse strains carrying conditional alleles of either Bard1 or Brca1 and used Cre recombination to inactivate these genes in mammary epithelial cells. Significantly, the conditional Bard1- and Brca1-mutant mice developed breast carcinomas that are indistinguishable from each other (and from those of double conditional Bard1/Brca1-mutant animals) with respect to their frequency, latency, histopathology, and cytogenetic features. Reminiscent of the basal-like breast carcinomas seen in human BRCA1 mutation carriers, these tumors are \"triple negative\" for estrogen and progesterone receptor expression and HER2/neu amplification. They also express basal cytokeratins CK5 and CK14, have an elevated frequency of p53 lesions, and display high levels of chromosomal instability. The remarkable similarities between the mammary carcinomas of Bard1-, Brca1-, and Bard1/Brca1-mutant mice indicate that the tumor suppressor activities of both genes are mediated through the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer.",

    "abstract": "Activating mutations in NOTCH1 are the most prominent genetic abnormality in T-cell acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) and inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling with gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) has been proposed as targeted therapy in this disease. However, most T-ALL cell lines with mutations in NOTCH1 fail to respond to GSI therapy. Using gene expression profiling and mutation analysis we showed that mutational loss of PTEN is a common event in T-ALL and is associated with resistance to NOTCH inhibition. Furthermore, our studies revealed that NOTCH1 induces upregulation of the PI3K-AKT pathway via HES1, which negatively controls the expression of PTEN. This regulatory circuitry is evolutionary conserved from Drosophila to humans as demonstrated by the interaction of overexpression of Delta and Akt in a model of Notch-induced transformation in the fly eye. Loss of PTEN and constitutive activation of AKT in T-ALL induce increased glucose metabolism and bypass the requirement of NOTCH1 signaling to sustain cell growth. Importantly, PTEN-null/GSI resistant T-ALL cells switch their oncogene addiction from NOTCH1 to AKT and are highly sensitive to AKT inhibitors. These results should facilitate the development of molecular therapies targeting NOTCH1 and AKT for the treatment of T-ALL.",

Mutation was associated with loss of heterozygosity of the wild-type allele. BAF180 complementation of BAF180-mutant tumor cells caused G(1) arrest that was dependent on increased expression of the cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21/WAF1/CIP1. Endogenous wild-type BAF180 bound to the p21 promoter and was required for proper p21 expression and G(1) arrest after transforming growth factor-beta and gamma-radiation treatment. BAF180 thus functions on two tumor suppressor signaling pathways as a physiologic mediator of p21 expression. We conclude that BAF180 suppresses tumorigenesis, at least in part, through its ability to regulate p21.",

MRN is essential for cell viability, which has limited functional studies of the complex. Small-molecule inhibitors of MRN could circumvent this experimental limitation and could also be used as cellular radio- and chemosensitization compounds. Using cell-free systems that recapitulate faithfully the MRN-ATM signaling pathway, we designed a forward chemical genetic screen to identify inhibitors of the pathway, and we isolated 6-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-thioxo-2,3-dihydro-4(1H)-pyrimidinone (mirin, 1) as an inhibitor of MRN. Mirin prevents MRN-dependent activation of ATM without affecting ATM protein kinase activity, and it inhibits Mre11-associated exonuclease activity. Consistent with its ability to target the MRN complex, mirin abolishes the G2/M checkpoint and homology-dependent repair in mammalian cells.",

    "abstract": "SIRT1 is an NAD-dependent deacetylase critically involved in stress responses, cellular metabolism and, possibly, ageing. The tumour suppressor p53 represents the first non-histone substrate functionally regulated by acetylation and deacetylation; we and others previously found that SIRT1 promotes cell survival by deacetylating p53 (refs 4-6). These results were further supported by the fact that p53 hyperacetylation and increased radiation-induced apoptosis were observed in Sirt1-deficient mice. Nevertheless, SIRT1-mediated deacetylase function is also implicated in p53-independent pathways under different cellular contexts, and its effects on transcriptional factors such as members of the FOXO family and PGC-1alpha directly modulate metabolic responses. These studies validate the importance of the deacetylase activity of SIRT1, but how SIRT1 activity is regulated in vivo is not well understood. Here we show that DBC1 (deleted in breast cancer 1) acts as a native inhibitor of SIRT1 in human cells. DBC1-mediated repression of SIRT1 leads to increasing levels of p53 acetylation and upregulation of p53-mediated function. In contrast, depletion of endogenous DBC1 by RNA interference (RNAi) stimulates SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of p53 and inhibits p53-dependent apoptosis. Notably, these effects can be reversed in cells by concomitant knockdown of endogenous SIRT1. Our study demonstrates that DBC1 promotes p53-mediated apoptosis through specific inhibition of SIRT1.",

    "abstract": "The ARF tumor suppressor is a crucial component of the cellular response to hyperproliferative signals, including oncogene activation, and functions by inducing a p53-dependent cell growth arrest and apoptosis program. It has recently been reported that the ARF mRNA can produce a smARF isoform that lacks the NH(2)-terminal region required for p53 activation. Overexpression of this isoform can induce autophagy, a cellular process characterized by the formation of cytoplasmic vesicles and the digestion of cellular content, independently of p53. However, the level of this isoform is extremely low in cells, and it remains unclear whether the predominant form of ARF, the full-length protein, is able to activate autophagy. Here, we show that full-length ARF can induce autophagy in 293T cells where p53 is inactivated by viral proteins, and, notably, expression of the NH(2)-terminal region alone, which is required for nucleolar localization, is sufficient for autophagy activation, independently of p53. Given the reported ability of p53 to induce autophagy, we also investigated the role of p53 in ARF-mediated autophagy induction. We found that full-length ARF expression induces p53 activation and promotes autophagy in a p53-positive cell line, and that ARF-mediated autophagy can be abrogated, at least in part, by RNAi-mediated knockdown of p53 in this cellular context. Thus, our findings modify the current view regarding the mechanism of autophagy induction by ARF and suggest an important role for autophagy in tumor suppression via full-length ARF in both p53-dependent and p53-independent manners, depending on cellular context.",

The p53 tumor suppressor is a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcriptional factor that plays a central role in regulating growth arrest and apoptosis during the stress response. Notably, recent studies indicate that both the stability and the subcellular localization of p53 are tightly regulated by ubiquitination; p53 is mainly ubiquitinated by Mdm2 but other ubiquitin ligases such as ARF-BP1/HectH9/MULE are also involved in p53 regulation in vivo. Moreover, a deubiquitinase HAUSP was initially identified in p53 deubiquitination but more recent studies showed that both Mdm2 and Mdmx are also bona fide substrates of HAUSP. In this article, we review our latest understanding of ubiquitination in modulating the p53 tumor suppression pathway.",

    "abstract": "Most human B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (B-NHLs) derive from germinal centers (GCs), the structure in which B cells undergo somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR) before being selected for high-affinity antibody production. The pathogenesis of B-NHL is associated with distinct genetic lesions, including chromosomal translocations and aberrant SHM, which arise from mistakes occurring during CSR and SHM. A direct link between these DNA remodeling events and GC lymphoma development, however, has not been demonstrated. Here we have crossed three mouse models of B cell lymphoma driven by oncogenes (Myc, Bcl6 and Myc/Bcl6; refs. 5,6) with mice lacking activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), the enzyme required for both CSR and SHM. We show that AID deficiency prevents Bcl6-dependent, GC-derived B-NHL, but has no impact on Myc-driven, pre-GC lymphomas. Accordingly, abrogation of AID is associated with the disappearance of CSR- and SHM-mediated structural alterations. These results show that AID is required for GC-derived lymphomagenesis, supporting the notion that errors in AID-mediated antigen-receptor gene modification processes are principal contributors to the pathogenesis of human B-NHL.",

    "abstract": "Basal-like breast cancer (BBC) is a subtype of breast cancer with poor prognosis. Inherited mutations of BRCA1, a cancer susceptibility gene involved in double-strand DNA break (DSB) repair, lead to breast cancers that are nearly always of the BBC subtype; however, the precise molecular lesions and oncogenic consequences of BRCA1 dysfunction are poorly understood. Here we show that heterozygous inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene Pten leads to the formation of basal-like mammary tumors in mice, and that loss of PTEN expression is significantly associated with the BBC subtype in human sporadic and BRCA1-associated hereditary breast cancers. In addition, we identify frequent gross PTEN mutations, involving intragenic chromosome breaks, inversions, deletions and micro copy number aberrations, specifically in BRCA1-deficient tumors. These data provide an example of a specific and recurrent oncogenic consequence of BRCA1-dependent dysfunction in DNA repair and provide insight into the pathogenesis of BBC with therapeutic implications. These findings also argue that obtaining an accurate census of genes mutated in cancer will require a systematic examination for gross gene rearrangements, particularly in tumors with deficient DSB repair.",

    "abstract": "The BRCA1 tumor suppressor exists as a heterodimeric complex with BARD1, and this complex is thought to mediate many of the functions ascribed to BRCA1, including its role in tumor suppression. The two proteins share a common structural organization that features an N-terminal RING domain and two C-terminal BRCT motifs, whereas BARD1 alone also contains three tandem ankyrin repeats. In normal cells, the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer is believed to enhance chromosome stability by promoting homology-directed repair (HDR) of double strand DNA breaks. Here we have investigated the structural requirements for BARD1 in this process by complementation of Bard1-null mouse mammary carcinoma cells. Our results demonstrate that the ankyrin and BRCT motifs of BARD1 are each essential for both chromosome stability and HDR. Tandem BRCT motifs, including those found at the C terminus of BARD1, are known to form a phosphoprotein recognition module. Nonetheless, the HDR function of BARD1 was not perturbed by synthetic mutations predicted to ablate the phospho-recognition activity of its BRCT sequences, suggesting that some functions of the BRCT domains are not dependent on their ability to bind phosphorylated ligands. Also, cancer-associated missense mutations in the BRCT domains of BARD1 (e.g. C557S, Q564H, V695L, and S761N) have been observed in patients with breast, ovarian, and endometrial tumors. However, none of these was found to affect the HDR activity of BARD1, suggesting that any increased cancer risk conferred by these mutations is not because of defects in this repair mechanism.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitin-specific protease HAUSP is a critical component of the p53-Mdm2 pathway by acting as a specific deubiquitinase for both p53 and Mdm2. Recent structural studies have indicated that p53 and Mdm2 bind to the N-terminal TRAF-like domain of HAUSP in a mutually exclusive manner. To understand the mechanism of HAUSP-mediated effects, we have created a p53 mutant that lacks HAUSP binding based on the crystal structure analysis. Indeed, this mutant p53 protein can be degraded by Mdm2 but fails to interact with HAUSP both in vitro and in vivo. Surprisingly, however, we have found that direct interaction between HAUSP and p53 is not absolutely required for it to antagonize efficiently Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 and that HAUSP is capable of enzymatically functioning in trans on p53 by using Mdm2 as a bridge. Further, we show that a trimeric protein complex containing p53, Mdm2 and HAUSP can exist in vivo, despite mutually exclusive binding, with Mdm2 serving as a binding mediator for p53 and HAUSP. These findings reveal the complication of HAUSP-mediated effects in the p53-Mdm2 interplay. It also has important implications for the development of novel chemotherapeutic compounds aimed at blocking this protein-protein interaction.",

These events are associated with considerable genotoxic stress, which cells tolerate through suppression of DNA-damage responses by Bcl-6, a transcription factor required for the formation of germinal centers. Here we show that the expression of Bcl-6 is regulated by DNA damage through a signaling pathway that promotes Bcl-6 degradation. After DNA damage accumulated, the kinase ATM promoted Bcl-6 phosphorylation, leading to its interaction with the isomerase Pin1 and its degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Because Bcl-6 is required for the maintenance of germinal centers, our findings suggest that the extent of genotoxic stress controls the fate of germinal center B cells by means of Bcl-6.",

However, the enthusiasm for these therapies has been tempered by tumor resistance and the paucity of information on the oncogenic programs regulated by oncogenic NOTCH1. Here we show that NOTCH1 regulates the expression of PTEN (encoding phosphatase and tensin homolog) and the activity of the phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling pathway in normal and leukemic T cells. Notch signaling and the PI3K-AKT pathway synergize in vivo in a Drosophila melanogaster model of Notch-induced tumorigenesis, and mutational loss of PTEN is associated with human T-ALL resistance to pharmacological inhibition of NOTCH1. Overall, these findings identify transcriptional control of PTEN and regulation of the PI3K-AKT pathway as key elements of the leukemogenic program activated by NOTCH1 and provide the basis for the design of new therapeutic strategies for T-ALL.",

Post-GC development of B cells requires BCL6 downregulation, while its constitutive expression caused by chromosomal translocations leads to diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Herein we identify a signaling pathway that downregulates BCL6 expression in normal GC B cells and is blocked in a subset of DLBCL due to alterations in the BCL6 gene. Activation of the CD40 receptor leads to NF-kappaB-mediated induction of the IRF4 transcription factor, which, in turn, represses BCL6 expression by binding to its promoter region. A subset of DLBCL displays chromosomal translocations or mutations that disrupt the IRF4-responsive region in the BCL6 promoter and block its downregulation by CD40 signaling.",

    "abstract": "As a central regulator for cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and cellular senescence, p53 requires multiple layers of regulatory control to ensure correct temporal and spatial functions. It is well accepted that Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination plays a crucial role in p53 regulation. In addition to proteasome-mediated degradation, ubiquitination of p53 by Mdm2 acts a key signal for its nuclear export. Nuclear export has previously been thought to require the disassociation of the p53 tetramer and exposure of the intrinsic nuclear export signal. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of degradation-independent repression on p53 by Mdm2, we have developed a two-step approach to purify ubiquitinated forms of p53 induced by Mdm2 from human cells. Surprisingly, however, we found that ubiquitination has no effect on the tetramerization/oligomerization of p53, arguing against this seemingly well accepted model. Moreover, nuclear export of p53 alone is not sufficient to completely abolish p53 activity. Ubiquitination-mediated repression of p53 by Mdm2 acts at least, in part, through inhibiting the sequence-specific DNA binding activity. Thus, our results have important implications regarding the mechanisms by which Mdm2 acts on p53.",

Molecular studies in these types of cancers have highlighted novel components upstream and downstream of this central oncogenic pathway. Beta-catenin gain-of-function mutations are strongly linked to WT1 loss-of-function mutations in syndromic Wilms tumors, and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling increases androgen receptor mRNA expression and blocks apoptosis in prostate cancers. Novel downstream target genes activated by Wnt/beta-catenin signaling are emerging from expression profiling in genetically defined classes of Wilms tumors, and similar analyses are expected to reveal additional downstream genes of this pathway specific to prostate cancers.

However, the biological functions required by c-Myc to induce oncogenesis remain elusive. Here we show that c-Myc has a direct role in the control of DNA replication. c-Myc interacts with the pre-replicative complex and localizes to early sites of DNA synthesis. Depletion of c-Myc from mammalian (human and mouse) cells as well as from Xenopus cell-free extracts, which are devoid of RNA transcription, demonstrates a non-transcriptional role for c-Myc in the initiation of DNA replication. Overexpression of c-Myc causes increased replication origin activity with subsequent DNA damage and checkpoint activation. These findings identify a critical function of c-Myc in DNA replication and suggest a novel mechanism for its normal and oncogenic functions.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal translocations are a hallmark of hematopoietic malignancies. The initial molecular events or pathways that lead to translocations in hematopoietic cells are largely unknown, particularly in the stem cell-enriched population postulated to be the initial target for these events. We used in vitro differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells combined with an I-SceI endonuclease double-strand break (DSB) repair assay to determine the relative susceptibility of isogenic hematopoietic subpopulations to DSB-induced translocations and the mechanisms that generate them. DSB-induced reciprocal translocations were frequently observed in multipotent progenitors but significantly suppressed in actively proliferating myeloid cells. Most reciprocal translocations in multipotent progenitors resulted from repair consistent with single-strand annealing followed by gap repair. Overexpression of Rad51, a protein central to DNA strand exchange and recombination, did not further increase the frequency of recovered translocations but did increase the frequency of long-tract gene conversion events associated with loss of heterozygosity and tandem duplications. These data directly demonstrate that hematopoietic multipotent progenitor cells are particularly susceptible to the formation of chromosomal rearrangements analogous to those observed in human hematopoietic malignancies. This particular subpopulation apparently represents a window of opportunity for the initiation of potentially oncogenic events following DNA damage.",

    "abstract": "Pathway-specific therapy is the future of cancer management. The oncogenic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is frequently activated in solid tumors; however, currently, no reliable test for PI3K pathway activation exists for human tumors. Taking advantage of the observation that loss of PTEN, the negative regulator of PI3K, results in robust activation of this pathway, we developed and validated a microarray gene expression signature for immunohistochemistry (IHC)-detectable PTEN loss in breast cancer (BC). The most significant signature gene was PTEN itself, indicating that PTEN mRNA levels are the primary determinant of PTEN protein levels in BC. Some PTEN IHC-positive BCs exhibited the signature of PTEN loss, which was associated to moderately reduced PTEN mRNA levels cooperating with specific types of PIK3CA mutations and/or amplification of HER2. This demonstrates that the signature is more sensitive than PTEN IHC for identifying tumors with pathway activation. In independent data sets of breast, prostate, and bladder carcinoma, prediction of pathway activity by the signature correlated significantly to poor patient outcome. Stathmin, encoded by the signature gene STMN1, was an accurate IHC marker of the signature and had prognostic significance in BC. Stathmin was also pathway-pharmacodynamic in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the signature or its components such as stathmin may be clinically useful tests for stratification of patients for anti-PI3K pathway therapy and monitoring therapeutic efficacy. This study indicates that aberrant PI3K pathway signaling is strongly associated with metastasis and poor survival across carcinoma types, highlighting the enormous potential impact on patient survival that pathway inhibition could achieve.",

    "abstract": "The p53 tumor suppressor is regulated by post-translational modification, including ubiquitination, phosphorylation and acetylation. It has previously been shown that the ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 also promotes the conjugation of Nedd8, a ubiquitin-like protein, to p53, inhibiting its transcriptional activity. We report the identification of FBXO11, a member of the F-box protein family and a component of the Skp1.Cullin1.F-box (SCF) complex, as a new p53-interacting protein. We show that FBXO11 promotes the neddylation of p53 both in vitro and in vivo. In addition to the C-terminal lysine residues, FBXO11 can also promote Nedd8 conjugation to Lys-320 and Lys-321, and neddylation of p53 leads to suppression of p53 function. This is consistent with recent studies showing that a lysine to arginine mutation at Lys-320 significantly enhances p53 function, although Lys-320 was originally identified as an acetylation site involving PCAF-mediated activation of p53. Our study provides an example of an F-box protein acting as an adaptor protein that can mediate the neddylation of a non-cullin substrate.",

However, the molecular mechanisms that govern the choice between cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis are not well understood. Here, we show that Tip60 is required for both cell growth arrest and apoptosis mediated by p53 and also induces its acetylation specifically at lysine 120 (K120) within the DNA-binding domain. Interestingly, this modification is crucial for p53-dependent apoptosis but is dispensable for its mediated growth arrest. K120 is a recurrent site for p53 mutation in human cancer, and the corresponding acetylation-defective tumor mutant (K120R) abrogates p53-mediated apoptosis, but not growth arrest. Thus, our study demonstrates that Tip60-dependent acetylation of p53 at K120 modulates the decision between cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis, and it reveals that the DNA-binding core domain is an important target for p53 regulation by posttranslational modifications.",

    "abstract": "Molecular profiling for classification and prognostic purposes has demonstrated that the genetic signatures of tumors contain information regarding biological properties as well as clinical behavior. This review highlights the progress that has been made in the field of gene expression profiling of human breast cancer. Breast cancer has become one of the most intensely studied human malignancies in the genomic era; several hundred papers over the last few years have investigated various clinical and biological aspects of human breast cancer using high-throughput molecular profiling techniques. Given the grossly heterogeneous nature of the disease and the lack of robust conventional markers for disease prediction, prognosis, and response to treatment, the notion that a transcriptional profile comprising multiple genes, rather than any single gene or other parameter, will be more predictive of tumor behavior is both appealing and reasonable. Promising results have emerged from these studies, correlating gene expression profiles with prognosis, recurrence, metastatic potential, therapeutic response, as well as biological and functional aspects of the disease. Clearly, the integration of genomic approaches into the clinic lies in the near future, but prospective studies based on larger patient cohorts representing the whole spectrum of breast cancer, oncogenic pathway-based studies, attendant care in bioinformatic analyses and validation studies are needed before the full promise of gene expression profiling can be realized in the clinical setting.",

By fueling several key features of tumor progression (deregulated proliferation, invasiveness, angiogenesis and metastasis), ID proteins contribute to multiple steps of tumorigenesis. Through oncogenic processes that lead to their aberrant activation in tumors, ID proteins transfer the phenotypic traits of embryonic stem cells to cancer cells. However, ID proteins have recently emerged as highly specialized factors in post-mitotic neurons. The elevated expression of ID proteins arrests neurons in the axon growth mode and prevents cessation of axonal elongation.

    "abstract": "The NOTCH1 signaling pathway directly links extracellular signals with transcriptional responses in the cell nucleus and plays a critical role during T cell development and in the pathogenesis over 50% of human T cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cases. However, little is known about the transcriptional programs activated by NOTCH1. Using an integrative systems biology approach we show that NOTCH1 controls a feed-forward-loop transcriptional network that promotes cell growth. Inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling in T-ALL cells led to a reduction in cell size and elicited a gene expression signature dominated by down-regulated biosynthetic pathway genes. By integrating gene expression array and ChIP-on-chip data, we show that NOTCH1 directly activates multiple biosynthetic routes and induces c-MYC gene expression. Reverse engineering of regulatory networks from expression profiles showed that NOTCH1 and c-MYC govern two directly interconnected transcriptional programs containing common target genes that together regulate the growth of primary T-ALL cells. These results identify c-MYC as an essential mediator of NOTCH1 signaling and integrate NOTCH1 activation with oncogenic signaling pathways upstream of c-MYC.",

Here, we report the analysis for activating NOTCH1 mutations in a large number of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) primary samples and cell lines. We found activating mutations in NOTCH1 in a single M0 primary AML sample, in three (ML1, ML2 and CTV-1) out of 23 AML cell lines and in the diagnostic (myeloid) and relapsed (T-lymphoid) clones in a patient with lineage switch leukemia. Importantly, the ML1 and ML2 AML cell lines are derived from an AML relapse in a patient initially diagnosed with T-ALL. Overall, these results demonstrate that activating mutations in NOTCH1 are mostly restricted to T-ALL and are rare in AMLs. The presence of NOTCH1 mutations in myeloid and T-lymphoid clones in lineage switch leukemias establishes the common clonal origin of the diagnostic and relapse blast populations and suggests a stem cell origin of NOTCH1 mutations during the molecular pathogenesis of these tumors.",

To test a possibility that PTEN might be one of the genes responsible for human sporadic pheochromocytoma, we performed mutation analysis of DNA obtained from tumors of 29 patients. However, direct sequencing of all nine exons of the PTEN gene, including the splice junctions, revealed no mutations. Examination of protein expression by immunohistochemistry using 8 normal adrenals and 11 sporadic pheochromocytomas showed no decrease in the PTEN protein expression in the tumor tissue, but upregulation of insulin-like growth factor II, a peptide implicated in growth of adrenal tissue, was observed in four cases (36%).",

TAL1/SCL is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor oncogene aberrantly expressed in 60% of human T-ALLs. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on chip to identify 71 direct transcriptional targets of TAL1/SCL. Promoters occupied by TAL1 were also frequently bound by the class I bHLH proteins E2A and HEB, suggesting that TAL1/E2A as well as TAL1/HEB heterodimers play a role in transformation of T-cell precursors. Using RNA interference, we demonstrated that TAL1 is required for the maintenance of the leukemic phenotype in Jurkat cells and showed that TAL1 binding can be associated with either repression or activation of genes whose promoters occupied by TAL1, E2A, and HEB. In addition, oligonucleotide microarray analysis of RNA from 47 primary T-ALL samples showed specific expression signatures involving TAL1 targets in TAL1-expressing compared with -nonexpressing human T-ALLs. Our results indicate that TAL1 may act as a bifunctional transcriptional regulator (activator and repressor) at the top of a complex regulatory network that disrupts normal T-cell homeostasis and contributes to leukemogenesis.",

    "abstract": "In the developing nervous system, Id2 (inhibitor of DNA binding 2, also known as inhibitor of differentiation 2) enhances cell proliferation, promotes tumour progression and inhibits the activity of neurogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors. The anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome and its activator Cdh1 (APC/C(Cdh1)) restrains axonal growth but the targets of APC/C(Cdh1) in neurons are unknown. Id2 and other members of the Id family are very unstable proteins that are eliminated as cells enter the quiescent state, but how they are targeted for degradation has remained elusive. Here we show that Id2 interacts with the core subunits of APC/C and Cdh1 in primary neurons. APC/C(Cdh1) targets Id2 for degradation through a destruction box motif (D box) that is conserved in Id1 and Id4. Depletion of Cdh1 stabilizes Id proteins in neurons, whereas Id2 D-box mutants are impaired for Cdh1 binding and remain stable in cells that exit from the cell cycle and contain active APC/C(Cdh1). Mutants of the Id2 D box enhance axonal growth in cerebellar granule neurons in vitro and in the context of the cerebellar cortex, and overcome the myelin inhibitory signals for growth. Conversely, activation of bHLH transcription factors induces a cluster of genes with potent axonal inhibitory functions including the gene coding for the Nogo receptor, a key transducer of myelin inhibition. Degradation of Id2 in neurons permits the accumulation of the Nogo receptor, thereby linking APC/C(Cdh1) activity with bHLH target genes for the inhibition of axonal growth. These findings indicate that deregulated Id activity might be useful to reprogramme quiescent neurons into the axonal growth mode.",

    "abstract": "Activating mutations in NOTCH1 are present in over 50% of human T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) samples and inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling with gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSI) has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of this disease. Here, we report a new human T-cell lymphoma line CUTLL1, which expresses high levels of activated NOTCH1 and is extremely sensitive to gamma-secretase inhibitors treatment. CUTLL1 cells harbor a t(7;9)(q34;q34) translocation which induces the expression of a TCRB-NOTCH1 fusion transcript encoding a membrane-bound truncated form of the NOTCH1 receptor. GSI treatment of CUTLL1 cells blocked NOTCH1 processing and caused rapid clearance of activated intracellular NOTCH1. Loss of NOTCH1 activity induced a gene expression signature characterized by the downregulation of NOTCH1 target genes such as HES1 and NOTCH3. In contrast with most human T-ALL cell lines with activating mutations in NOTCH1, CUTLL1 cells showed a robust cellular phenotype upon GSI treatment characterized by G1 cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis. These results show that the CUTLL1 cell line has a strong dependence on NOTCH1 signaling for proliferation and survival and supports that T-ALL patients whose tumors harbor t(7;9) should be included in clinical trials testing the therapeutic efficacy NOTCH1 inhibition with GSIs.",

    "abstract": "B cells producing high-affinity antibodies are destined to differentiate into memory B cells and plasma cells, but the mechanisms leading to those differentiation pathways are mostly unknown. Here we report that the transcription factor IRF4 is required for the generation of plasma cells. Transgenic mice with conditional deletion of Irf4 in germinal center B cells lacked post-germinal center plasma cells and were unable to differentiate memory B cells into plasma cells. Plasma cell differentiation required IRF4 as well as the transcriptional repressor Blimp-1, which both acted 'upstream' of the transcription factor XBP-1. In addition, IRF4-deficient B cells had impaired expression of activation-induced deaminase and lacked class-switch recombination, suggesting an independent function for IRF4 in this process. These results identify IRF4 as a crucial transcriptional 'switch' in the generation of functionally competent plasma cells.",

ARF-BP1, a HECT domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, interacts with ARF and p53. Its ubiquitin ligase activity is inhibited by ARF. Inactivation of ARF-BP1 stabilised p53 and induced apoptosis. Notably, inactivation of ARF-BP1 also caused cell growth repression in p53-null cells and breast cancer cells with mutant p53. Thus, ARF-BP1 emerges as a novel therapeutic target against cancer regardless of p53 status.",

    "title": "E Proteins and Id2 converge on p57Kip2 to regulate cell cycle in neural cells",
    "abstract": "A precise balance between proliferation and differentiation must be maintained during neural development to obtain the correct proportion of differentiated cell types in the adult nervous system. The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors known as E proteins and their natural inhibitors, the Id proteins, control the timing of differentiation and terminal exit from the cell cycle. Here we show that progression into S phase of human neuroblastoma cells is prevented by E proteins and promoted by Id2. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKI) have been identified as key effectors of cell cycle arrest in differentiating cells. However, p57Kip2 is the only CKI that is absolutely required for normal development. Through the use of global gene expression analysis in neuroblastoma cells engineered to acutely express the E protein E47 and Id2, we find that p57Kip2 is a target of E47. Consistent with the role of Id proteins, Id2 prevents activation of p57Kip2 expression, and the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, a known Id2 inhibitor, counters this activity. The strong E47-mediated inhibition of entry into S phase is entirely reversed in cells in which expression of p57Kip2 is silenced by RNA interference. During brain development, expression of p57Kip2 is opposite that of Id2. Our findings identify p57Kip2 as a functionally relevant target recruited by bHLH transcription factors to induce cell cycle arrest in developing neuroblasts and suggest that deregulated expression of Id proteins may be an epigenetic mechanism to silence expression of this CKI in neural tumors.",

    "abstract": "Imprinted genes control fetal and placental growth in mice and in rare human syndromes, but the role of these genes in sporadic intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is less well-studied. We measured the ratio of mRNA from a maternally expressed imprinted gene, PHLDA2, to that from a paternally expressed imprinted gene, MEST, by Northern blotting in 38 IUGR-associated placentae and 75 non-IUGR placentae and found an increase in the PHLDA2/MEST mRNA ratio in IUGR (p=0.0001). Altered expression of PHLDA2 and MEST was not accompanied by changes in DNA methylation within their imprinting centers, and immunohistochemistry showed PHLDA2 protein appropriately restricted to villous and intermediate cytotrophoblast in the IUGR placentae. We next did a genome-wide survey of mRNA expression in 14 IUGR placentae with maternal vascular under-perfusion compared to 15 non-IUGR placentae using Affymetrix U133A microarrays. In this series six imprinted genes were differentially expressed by ANOVA with a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate of 0.05, with increased expression of PHLDA2 and decreased expression of MEST, MEG3, GATM, GNAS and PLAGL1 in IUGR placentae. At lower significance, we found IGF2 mRNA decreased and CDKN1C mRNA increased in the IUGR cases. We confirmed the significant reduction in MEG3 non-translated RNA in IUGR placentae by Northern blotting. In addition to imprinted genes, the microarray data highlighted non-imprinted genes acting in endocrine signaling (LEP, CRH, HPGD, INHBA), tissue growth (IGF1), immune modulation (INDO, PSG-family genes), oxidative metabolism (GLRX), vascular function (AGTR1, DSCR1) and metabolite transport (SLC-family solute carriers) as differentially expressed in IUGR vs. non-IUGR placentae.",

    "abstract": "Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is necessary for immunoglobulin somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR) in T-dependent immune response in germinal centers (GCs). The structural similarity of AID with RNA-editing enzymes and its largely cytoplasmic location have fueled controversial views of its mode of interaction with DNA. We show that AID, a mature B-cell-restricted cytoplasmic antigen, is relocated into the nucleus in 2.5% of CDKN1B(-), CCNB1(-) GC cells. The GC dark zone and the outer zone (OZ), but not the light zone, contain nuclear and cytoplasmic AID(+) blasts. AID(+) cells in the OZ are in contact with T cells and CD23(-) follicular dendritic cells. In addition, AID is expressed in extrafollicular large proliferating B cells, 14% of which have nuclear AID. GC and extrafollicular AID(+) cells express E47 but not the inhibiting BHLH protein Id2. Outside the GC, AID(+) B cells are in contact with T cells and show partial evidence of CD40 plus bcr stimulation-dependent signature (CCL22, JunB, cMYC, CD30) but lack early and late plasma cell markers. The distribution of nuclear AID is consistent with the topography of SHM and CSR inside the GC and in extrafollicular activated B cells.",

    "abstract": "Progress on several unresolved issues in cancer epigenetics will benefit from rapid and standardized methods for profiling DNA methylation genome-wide. In the area of epigenetic therapy, the demethylating drug decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) is increasingly used to treat acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, but the mechanisms of its anticancer activity have remained unclear. Given the clinical efficacy of decitabine and the uncertainties about its mode of action, it will be useful to optimize methods for following DNA methylation as a biochemical response in individual patients. Here, we describe a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip-based method (MSNP) for profiling DNA methylation. Using this procedure, the extent of demethylation in bone marrow aspirates from patients with leukemia receiving decitabine can be assessed genome-wide using commercially available (Affymetrix) SNP chips. We validated the accuracy of MSNP by comparing the results with combined bisulfite restriction analysis and by sequencing cloned PCR products from bisulfite-converted DNA. We further validated MSNP in a Wilms' tumor/normal kidney comparison, comparing the results with methylation-sensitive Southern blotting. MSNP simultaneously detects aberrations in DNA copy number and loss of heterozygosity, making it a generally useful approach for combined genetic and epigenetic profiling in tissue samples from cancer patients.",

    "title": "The protein ENH is a cytoplasmic sequestration factor for Id2 in normal and tumor cells from the nervous system",
    "abstract": "Id2 is a natural inhibitor of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors and the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein. Active Id2 prevents differentiation and promotes cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis in the nervous system. A key event that regulates Id2 activity during differentiation is translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Here we show that the actin-associated protein enigma homolog (ENH) is a cytoplasmic retention factor for Id2. ENH contains three LIM domains, which bind to the helix-loop-helix domain of Id proteins in vitro and in vivo. ENH is up-regulated during neural differentiation, and its ectopic expression in neuroblastoma cells leads to translocation of Id2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, with consequent inactivation of transcriptional and cell-cycle-promoting functions of Id2. Conversely, silencing of ENH by RNA interference prevents cytoplasmic relocation of Id2 in neuroblastoma cells differentiated with retinoic acid. Finally, the differentiated neural crest-derived tumor ganglioneuroblastoma coexpresses Id2 and ENH in the cytoplasm of ganglionic cells. These data indicate that ENH contributes to differentiation of the nervous system through cytoplasmic sequestration of Id2. They also suggest that ENH is a restraining factor of the oncogenic activity of Id proteins in neural tumors.",

    "abstract": "PR domain containing 1 with zinc finger domain (PRDM1)/B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (BLIMP1) is a transcriptional repressor expressed in a subset of germinal center (GC) B cells and in all plasma cells, and required for terminal B cell differentiation. The BLIMP1 locus lies on chromosome 6q21-q22.1, a region frequently deleted in B cell lymphomas, suggesting that it may harbor a tumor suppressor gene. We report here that the BLIMP1 gene is inactivated by structural alterations in 24% (8 out of 34) activated B cell-like diffuse large cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL), but not in GC B cell-like (n = 0/37) or unclassified (n = 0/21) DLBCL. BLIMP1 alterations included gene truncations, nonsense mutations, frameshift deletions, and splice site mutations that generate aberrant transcripts encoding truncated BLIMP1 proteins. In all cases studied, both BLIMP1 alleles were inactivated by deletions or mutations. Furthermore, most non-GC type DLBCL cases (n = 20/26, 77%) lack BLIMP1 protein expression, despite the presence of BLIMP1 mRNA. These results indicate that a sizable fraction of ABC-DLBCL carry an inactive BLIMP1 gene, and suggest that the same gene is inactivated by epigenetic mechanisms in an additional large number of cases. These findings point to a role for BLIMP1 as a tumor suppressor gene, whose inactivation may contribute to lymphomagenesis by blocking post-GC differentiation of B cells toward plasma cells.",

    "abstract": "The PEG1 gene (a.k.a. MEST) is expressed in human placental trophoblast and endothelium, and data from knockout mice show that this gene regulates placental and fetal growth. Isoform 1 of PEG1 mRNA initiates from exon 1c and produces the long form of the MEST protein. This isoform is imprinted, with expression only from the paternal allele in many human and mouse organs, including placenta. In contrast, PEG1 isoform 2, initiating from exon 1a and producing the short form of MEST protein, is biallelically expressed (non-imprinted) in several non-placental organs. Here we show that PEG1 isoform 2 is in fact imprinted in a large subset of human placentae. A CpG island overlapping PEG1 exon 1a is unmethylated in various fetal and adult non-placental tissues, but is often substantially methylated in the placenta, with the extent of methylation in a large series approximating a normal distribution. Bisulfite conversion/sequencing indicates that the inter-individual differences reflect the relative representation of heavily methylated vs. unmethylated alleles, and RT-PCR/RFLP analysis shows strongly biased allelic expression of PEG1 isoform 2 mRNA in a majority of placentae with a high proportion of methylated alleles. These data highlight PEG1 isoform 2 as a marker for future studies of inter-individual epigenetic variation and its relation to placental and fetal growth in humans.",

    "abstract": "The product of the imprinted gene paternally expressed gene-10 (PEG10) has been reported to support proliferation in hepatocellular carcinomas, but how this gene is regulated has been an open question. We find that MYC knockdown by RNA interference suppresses PEG10 expression in Panc1 pancreatic carcinoma and HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells and that knockdown of PEG10 inhibits the proliferation of Panc1, HepG2, and Hep3B cells. Conversely, PEG10 was up-regulated by inducing c-MYC expression in a B-lymphocyte cell line. Chromatin immunoprecipitation from Panc1 cells showed c-MYC bound to an E-box-containing region in the PEG10 first intron and site-directed mutagenesis showed that the most proximal E-box is essential for promoter activity. In a mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-MYC transgenic mouse model of breast cancer, most but not all of the mammary carcinomas had strongly increased Peg10 mRNA compared with normal mammary gland. By immunohistochemistry, normal human breast and prostate epithelium was negative for the major isoform [reading frame-1 (RF1)] of PEG10 protein, but this cytoplasmic protein was strongly expressed in a subset of breast carcinomas in situ and invasive ductal carcinomas ( approximately 30%) and in a similar percentage of prostate cancers. As in the mouse model, we found positive, but not absolute, correlations between PEG10 and c-MYC in tissue arrays containing 161 human breast cancers (P < 0.002) and 30 prostate cancers (P = 0.014). Immunostaining of human placenta showed PEG10 and c-MYC proteins coexpressed in proliferating cytotrophoblast and coordinately lost in postmitotic syncytiotrophoblast. These findings link cancer genetics and epigenetics by showing that a classic proto-oncogene, MYC, acts directly upstream of a proliferation-positive imprinted gene, PEG10.",

    "title": "PKA-mediated phosphorylation regulates the function of activation-induced deaminase (AID) in B cells",
    "abstract": "During humoral immune responses, two distinct genetic modification events diversify the Ig genes in germinal center (GC) B cells: somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination (CSR). Both processes require the activity of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), an enzyme expressed specifically in GC B cells. However, the mechanisms that regulate AID activity are largely unknown. Here we report that protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates AID and regulates its activity in GC B cells. AID physically interacts with the PKA holoenzyme in the cytoplasm and is phosphorylated by the PKA catalytic subunit at specific residues. AID phosphorylation is required for CSR, because substitution of the two phosphorylation targets impairs its ability to rescue CSR in AID-deficient B cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of PKA prevents isotype class switching in a murine B-cell lymphoma cell line; conversely, B cells from mice where PKA activity is made constitutive by conditional deletion of the PKA regulatory subunit gene display enhanced CSR. These findings implicate PKA in the regulation of AID function and suggest that the control of T cell-dependent immune responses may be modulated, via AID, by signals that activate PKA.",

Imprinted genes are often strongly expressed in the placenta, and the allelic expression bias due to imprinting is sometimes stronger in this extraembryonic organ than in the embryo and adult. Mutations, epimutations, and uniparental disomies affecting imprinted loci cause placental stunting or overgrowth in mice and humans, and placental neoplasms (complete hydatidiform moles) are androgenetic. Whether imprinted genes might also play a role in the more common medical conditions that affect the placenta, including preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), is an important question that is now receiving some attention. Here we review this area and describe recent data indicating altered expression of imprinted genes in the placental response to maternal vascular underperfusion associated with IUGR.",

BCL6 functions by directly binding to specific DNA sequences and suppressing the transcription of target genes. Here we report an alternative mechanism by which BCL6 controls the transcription of genes lacking a BCL6 binding site and show that this mechanism was required for the prevention of tumor suppressor p53-independent cell cycle arrest in germinal center B cells. BCL6 interacted with the transcriptional activator Miz-1 and, via Miz-1, bound to the promoter and suppressed transcription of the cell cycle arrest gene CDKN1A. Through this mechanism, BCL6 may facilitate the proliferative expansion of germinal centers during the normal immune response and, when deregulated, the pathological expansion of B cell lymphomas.",

    "abstract": "To understand genetic and epigenetic pathways in Wilms' tumors, we carried out a genome scan for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) using Affymetrix 10K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips and supplemented the data with karyotype information. To score loss of imprinting (LOI) of the IGF2 gene, we assessed DNA methylation of the H19 5' differentially methylated region (DMR). Few chromosomal regions other than band 11p13 (WT1) were lost in Wilms' tumors from Denys-Drash and Wilms' tumor-aniridia syndromes, whereas sporadic Wilms' tumors showed LOH of several regions, most frequently 11p15 but also 1p, 4q, 7p, 11q, 14q, 16q, and 17p. LOI was common in the sporadic Wilms' tumors but absent in the syndromic cases. The SNP chips identified novel centers of LOH in the sporadic tumors, including a 2.4-Mb minimal region on chromosome 4q24-q25. Losses of chromosomes 1p, 14q, 16q, and 17p were more common in tumors presenting at an advanced stage; 11p15 LOH was seen at all stages, whereas LOI was associated with early-stage presentation. Wilms' tumors with LOI often completely lacked LOH in the genome-wide analysis, and in some tumors with concomitant 16q LOH and LOI, the loss of chromosome 16q was mosaic, whereas the H19 DMR methylation was complete. These findings confirm molecular differences between sporadic and syndromic Wilms' tumors, define regions of recurrent LOH, and indicate that gain of methylation at the H19 DMR is an early event in Wilms' tumorigenesis that is independent of chromosomal losses. The data further suggest a biological difference between sporadic Wilms' tumors with and without LOI.",

    "abstract": "Although the importance of the ARF tumor suppressor in p53 regulation is well established, numerous studies indicate that ARF also suppresses cell growth in a p53/Mdm2-independent manner. To understand the mechanism of ARF-mediated tumor suppression, we identified a ubiquitin ligase, ARF-BP1, as a key factor associated with ARF in vivo. ARF-BP1 harbors a signature HECT motif, and its ubiquitin ligase activity is inhibited by ARF. Notably, inactivation of ARF-BP1, but not Mdm2, suppresses the growth of p53 null cells in a manner reminiscent of ARF induction. Surprisingly, in p53 wild-type cells, ARF-BP1 directly binds and ubiquitinates p53, and inactivation of endogenous ARF-BP1 is crucial for ARF-mediated p53 stabilization. Thus, our study modifies the current view of ARF-mediated p53 activation and reveals that ARF-BP1 is a critical mediator of both the p53-independent and p53-dependent tumor suppressor functions of ARF. As such, ARF-BP1 may serve as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in tumors regardless of p53 status.",

Inhibition of CHK1 leads to the accumulation of double-stranded DNA breaks. Loss of PTEN impairs CHK1-mediated checkpoint activation due to cytoplasmic sequestration of ubiquitinated CHK1. Here, we provide evidence that another consequence of reduced CHK1 function in PTEN deficient cells is the accumulation of double-stranded DNA breaks. Moreover, we show that the site of CHK1 ubiquitination (K274) is near the site of AKT phosphorylation (S280). Overall, these data demonstrate that lack of PTEN generates DNA damage due to inappropriate inactivation of CHK1.DNA damage due to the loss of PTEN is likely to stimulate tumor development.",

    "abstract": "Although the BRCA1 tumor suppressor has been implicated in a number of cellular processes, it plays an especially important role in the DNA damage response as a regulator of cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair pathways. In vivo, BRCA1 exists as a heterodimer with the BARD1 protein, and many of its biological functions are mediated by the BRCA1-BARD1 complex. Here, we show that BARD1 is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner and that the hyperphosphorylated forms of BARD1 predominate during M phase. By mobility shift analysis and mass spectrometry, we have identified seven sites of mitotic phosphorylation within BARD1. All sites exist within either an SP or TP sequence, and two sites resemble the consensus motif recognized by cyclin-dependent kinases. To examine the functional consequences of BARD1 phosphorylation, we used a gene targeting knock-in approach to generate isogenic cell lines that express either wild-type or mutant forms of the BARD1 polypeptide. Analysis of these lines in clonogenic survival assays revealed that cells bearing phosphorylation site mutations are hypersensitive to mitomycin C, a genotoxic agent that induces interstrand DNA cross-links. These results implicate BARD1 phosphorylation in the cellular response to DNA damage.",

To investigate the role of BCL6 in DLBCL pathogenesis, we have engineered mice that express BCL6 constitutively in B cells by mimicking a chromosomal translocation found in human DLBCL. These mice display increased GC formation and perturbed post-GC differentiation characterized by a decreased number of post-isotype switch plasma cells. Subsequently, these mice develop a lymphoproliferative syndrome that culminates with the development of lymphomas displaying features typical of human DLBCL. These results define the oncogenic role of BCL6 in the pathogenesis of DLBCL and provide a faithful mouse model of this common disease.",

In this study, a mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes PRDM1 was used to detail its distribution in normal human lymphoid tissue and in lymphoid neoplasms that correspond to different stages of B-cell differentiation. PRDM1 was expressed in germinal centre blasts that co-express Pax5, CD19, CD20, and CD10, but not BCL6 or MTA-3. Pax5 was downregulated and full plasma cell morphology and phenotype were acquired by PRDM1+, nuclear cREL-, pre-plasma cells upon exit from the germinal centre. Activated extrafollicular B-cells (CD30+, Pax5+) were largely PRDM1-. PRDM1 was also absent in tissue histiocytes and the majority of resting T-cells and S-100+ antigen-presenting cells. PRDM1 and CD138 were expressed simultaneously in human lymphomas with plasma cell differentiation, but not in marginal zone lymphomas or chronic lymphocytic leukaemias. A minority of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas expressed PRDM1 and Hodgkin lymphomas were largely PRDM1-. Infiltrating T-cells in PRDM1- B-cell lymphomas expressed PRDM1. In conclusion, PRDM1 staining is a reliable and informative assay to define plasma cell commitment and differentiation in human normal and neoplastic B-cell lineages.",

    "abstract": "The inhibitor of differentiation Id2 is a target of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein during mouse embryogenesis. In Rb(+/-) mice, LOH at the wild-type Rb allele initiates pituitary adenocarcinoma, a tumor derived from embryonic melanotropes. Here we identify a critical role for Id2 in initiation, growth, and angiogenesis of pituitary tumors from Rb(+/-) mice. We show that proliferation and differentiation are intimately coupled in Rb(+/-) pituitary cells before tumor initiation. In Id2-null pituitaries, premature activation of basic helix-loop-helix-mediated transcription and expression of the cdk inhibitor p27(Kip1) impairs the proliferation of melanotropes and tumor initiation. Without Id2, Rb(+/-) mice have fewer early tumor lesions and a markedly decreased proliferation rate of the tumor foci. Expression of Id2 by pituitary tumor cells promotes growth and angiogenesis by functioning as a master regulator of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In human neuroblastoma, the N-Myc-driven expression of Id2 is sufficient and necessary for expression of VEGF. These results establish that aberrant Id2 activity directs initiation and progression of embryonal cancer.",

    "abstract": "Deregulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway either through loss of PTEN or mutation of the catalytic subunit alpha of PI3K (PIK3CA) occurs frequently in human cancer. We identified PIK3CA mutations in 26% of 342 human breast tumor samples and cell lines at about equal frequency in tumor stages I to IV. To investigate the relationship between PTEN and PIK3CA, we generated a cohort of tumors that had lost PTEN expression and compared it with a matched control set that had retained PTEN. A highly significant association between PIK3CA mutations and retention of PTEN protein expression was observed. In addition, PIK3CA mutations were associated with expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER/PR), lymph node metastasis, and ERBB2 overexpression. The fact that PIK3CA mutations and PTEN loss are nearly mutually exclusive implies that deregulated phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP(3)) is critical for tumorigenesis in a significant fraction of breast cancers and that loss of PIP(3) homeostasis by abrogation of either PIK3CA or PTEN relieves selective pressure for targeting of the other gene. The correlation of PIK3CA mutation to ER/PR-positive tumors and PTEN loss to ER/PR-negative tumors argues for disparate branches of tumor evolution. Furthermore, the association between ERBB2 overexpression and PIK3CA mutation implies that more than one input activating the PI3K/AKT pathway may be required to overcome intact PTEN. Thus, mutation of PIK3CA is frequent, occurs early in carcinoma development, and has prognostic and therapeutic implications.",

    "abstract": "Loss of chromosome arm 18q is a common event in human pancreatic, colon, and breast cancers and is often interpreted as representing loss of one or more tumor-suppressor genes. In this article, we describe two novel biallelic deletions at chromosome band 18q21.1 in a recently characterized human breast cancer cell line, HCC-1428. One lesion deletes a fragment of approximately 300 kb between SMAD4 and DCC that encodes no known genes. The second lesion is an in-frame SMAD4 deletion (amino acids 49-51) that affects the level of SMAD4 protein but not the SMAD4 message. This change accelerates 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of both endogenous and exogenous mutant SMAD4. Examination of normal DNA from the same patient demonstrated that both lesions are somatic and associated with loss of both normal alleles. These data support the concept that two independent tumor-suppressor loci exist at chromosome segment 18q21.1, one at SMAD4 and the other potentially at an enhancer of DCC or an unrelated novel gene.",

    "abstract": "Genomic instability is characteristic of malignant cells, and a strong correlation exists between abnormal karyotype and tumorigenicity. Increased expression of the homologous recombination and DNA repair protein Rad51 has been reported in immortalized cell lines and multiple primary tumor cell types which could alter recombination pathways to contribute to the chromosomal rearrangements found in these cells. In addition, Rad51 participates in a complex network of interactions that includes DNA damage sensors, tumor suppressors, and cell cycle and apoptotic regulators, and mutation of many of these proteins have also been associated with tumor initiation or progression. Insights into the connection between disregulated Rad51 and malignant phenotype indicate that Rad51 is a potential target for new anti-cancer regimens including those that use siRNA technology.",

    "abstract": "Pten-/- cells display a partially defective checkpoint in response to ionizing radiation (IR). The checkpoint defect was traced to the ability of AKT to phosphorylate CHK1 at serine 280, since a nonphosphorylated mutant of CHK1 (S280A) complemented the checkpoint defect and restored CDC25A degradation. CHK1 phosphorylation at serine 280 led to covalent binding of 1 to 2 molecules of ubiquitin and cytoplasmic CHK1 localization. Primary breast carcinomas lacking PTEN expression and having elevated AKT phosphorylation had increased cytoplasmic CHK1 and displayed aneuploidy (p <0.005). We conclude that loss of PTEN and subsequent activation of AKT impair CHK1 through phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and reduced nuclear localization to promote genomic instability in tumor cells.",

    "abstract": "For many decades, B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) stood out as a B cell-derived malignancy that was difficult to position within the framework of the available B cell differentiation scheme: First, the histology as well as the immunophenotype did not quite resemble that of any normal lymphocyte; second, in contrast to almost all other B cell tumor subtypes, the immunoglobulin variable region (IgV) genes of B-CLL cases could be either unmutated or somatically mutated; third, the genomic lesions observed in B-CLL were markedly distinct from those of the other major B cell malignancies, which typically exhibit balanced chromosome translocations. Recent advances in the characterization of both B-CLL and normal B cell subpopulations by phenotypic analysis, global gene expression profiling, as well as extensive IgV gene repertoire analyses have shed new light on the phenotype and the cell derivation of B-CLL and provided novel hypotheses concerning its pathogenesis. Here we summarize recent work relevant to these issues and conclude that B-CLL may be derived from a cell that can be referred to as a marginal zone B cell. Moreover, we propose that the lack of chromosomal translocations in B-CLL may be related to their derivation from marginal zone B cells, since somatic hypermutation and Ig class switch, the processes that generate chromosome translocations in most germinal center (GC)-derived malignancies, are no longer active in marginal zone B cells. Also, we discuss similarities and differences between B-CLL and hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and suggest that also HCL may be derived from a post-GC memory or marginal zone B cell.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, the fetal liver is the first site of definitive erythropoiesis-the generation of mature, enucleated red cells. The functional unit for definitive erythropoiesis is the erythroblastic island, a multicellular structure composed of a central macrophage surrounded by erythroblasts at various stages of differentiation. Targeted disruption of the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumour suppressor gene in the mouse leads to embryonic death caused by failure of erythroblasts to enucleate. The erythroid defect has been attributed to loss of Rb in cells that support erythropoiesis, but the identity of these cells is unknown. Here we show that Rb-deficient embryos carry profound abnormalities of fetal liver macrophages that prevent physical interactions with erythroblasts. In contrast, wild-type macrophages bind Rb-deficient erythroblasts and lead them to terminal differentiation and enucleation. Loss of Id2, a helix-loop-helix protein that mediates the lethality of Rb-deficient embryos, rescues the defects of Rb-deficient fetal liver macrophages. Rb promotes differentiation of macrophages by opposing the inhibitory functions of Id2 on the transcription factor PU.1, a master regulator of macrophage differentiation. Thus, Rb has a cell autonomous function in fetal liver macrophages, and restrains Id2 in these cells in order to implement definitive erythropoiesis.",

    "abstract": "Substantial evidence indicates that signaling through the CD40 receptor (CD40) is required for germinal center (GC) and memory B-cell formation. However, it is not fully understood at which stages of B-cell development the CD40 pathway is activated in vivo. To address this question, we induced CD40 signaling in human transformed GC B cells in vitro and identified a CD40 gene expression signature by DNA microarray analysis. This signature was then investigated in the gene expression profiles of normal B cells and found in pre- and post-GC B cells (naive and memory) but, surprisingly, not in GC B cells. This finding was validated in lymphoid tissues by showing that the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription factors, which translocate to the nucleus upon CD40 stimulation, are retained in the cytoplasm in most GC B cells, indicating the absence of CD40 signaling. Nevertheless, a subset of centrocytes and B cells in the subepithelium showed nuclear staining of multiple NF-kappaB subunits, suggesting that a fraction of naive and memory B cells may be subject to CD40 signaling or to other signals that activate NF-kappaB. Together, these results show that GC expansion occurs in the absence of CD40 signaling, which may act only in the initial and final stages of the GC reaction.",

    "abstract": "The human proto-oncogene BCL6 encodes a BTB/POZ-zinc-finger transcriptional repressor that is necessary for germinal-centre formation and is implicated in the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphoma. The precise function of BCL6 in germinal-centre development and lymphomagenesis is unclear because very few direct BCL6 target genes have been identified. Here we report that BCL6 suppresses the expression of the p53 (also known as tp53) tumour suppressor gene and modulates DNA damage-induced apoptotic responses in germinal-centre B cells. BCL6 represses p53 transcription by binding two specific DNA sites within the p53 promoter region and, accordingly, p53 expression is absent in germinal-centre B cells where BCL6 is highly expressed. Suppression of BCL6 expression via specific short interfering RNA leads to increased levels of p53 messenger RNA and protein both under basal conditions and in response to DNA damage. Most notably, constitutive expression of BCL6 protects B cell lines from apoptosis induced by DNA damage. These results suggest that an important function of BCL6 is to allow germinal-centre B cells to tolerate the physiological DNA breaks required for immunoglobulin class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation without inducing a p53-dependent apoptotic response. These findings also imply that deregulated BCL6 expression contributes to lymphomagenesis in part by functional inactivation of p53.",

    "abstract": "Somatic hypermutation (SHM) targets primarily the immunoglobulin variable region (IgV) genes in germinal center (GC) B cells, thereby allowing antibody affinity maturation. A malfunction of SHM, termed aberrant somatic hypermutation (ASHM), was found in about 50% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), leading to mutations in the 5' sequences of multiple genes, including oncogenes. Although the SHM mechanism is largely unknown, it was shown to require the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) gene. AID mRNA is expressed in GC B cells and GC-derived lymphomas, but the pattern of expression of the AID protein is not known. Using 2 specific antibodies, here we show that the AID protein can be detected in GC centroblasts and their transformed counterpart (Burkitt lymphoma) but not in pre-GC B cells and post-GC neoplasms, including B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma. DLBCLs displayed variable levels of AID expression, which did not correlate with IgV ongoing hypermutation, ASHM, or disease subtype. Finally, both in normal and malignant B cells the AID protein appeared predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. These results indicate that the AID protein is specifically expressed in normal and transformed GC B cells; nonetheless, its predominantly cytoplasmic localization suggests that additional mechanisms may regulate its function and may be altered during lymphomagenesis.",

    "abstract": "Repression of gene transcription is mediated by histone deacetylases containing repressor-co-repressor complexes, which are recruited to promoters of target genes via interactions with sequence-specific transcription factors. The mammalian Sin3A co-repressor complex contains a core of at least seven proteins including the pRb-interacting protein RBP1 and a putative tumor suppressor p33(ING1b). By biochemical purification and mass spectrometry, we have identified a novel component p40 from this complex. p40 bears homology to both yeast Sds3, a component of yeast histone deacetylase complexes, and its mammalian homologue mSds3. The p40-associated complex purified from human cells shows a strong histone deacetylase activity. When tethered to a Gal-DNA binding domain, the Gal-p40 is able to significantly repress transcription of a Gal-luciferase promoter. Interestingly, database analysis reveals that p40 is also highly homologous to BRMS1, a breast carcinoma metastasis suppressor, and overexpression of p40 in human cells can significantly inhibit cell growth. Thus, our data indicate that p40 may be critically involved in transcription repression of cell growth-associated gene expression by recruiting the HDAC1 deacetylase complex.",

Paternal deletion of a cis-acting differentially methylated DNA element, Kvdmr1, causes coordinate loss of imprinting and over-expression of all of these genes and the resulting conceptuses show intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). To test the specific contribution of Phlda2 to IUGR in the Kvdmr1-knockout, we crossed Kvdmr1(+/-) males with Phlda2(+/-) females. Conceptuses with the (Phlda2(+/+); Kvdmr1(+/-)) genotype showed fetal and placental growth retardation. Restoration of Phlda2 dosage to normal, as occurred in the conceptuses with the (Phlda2(-/+); Kvdmr1(+/-)) genotype, had a marginally positive effect on fetal weights and no effect on post-natal weights, but significantly rescued the placental weights. As we previously reported, loss of Phlda2 expression in the wild-type background (Phlda2(-/+); Kvdmr1(+/+) genotype) caused placentomegaly. Thus Phlda2 acts as a true rheostat for placental growth, with overgrowth after gene deletion and growth retardation after loss of imprinting. Consistent with this conclusion, we observed significant placental stunting in BAC-transgenic mice that over-expressed Phlda2 and one flanking gene, Slc22a1l, but did not over-express Cdkn1c.",

    "abstract": "The BRCA1 tumor suppressor and the BARD1 protein form a stable heterodimeric complex that can catalyze the formation of polyubiquitin chains. Expression of BRCA1 fluctuates in a cell cycle-dependent manner, such that low steady-state levels of BRCA1 gene products are found in resting cells and early G1 cycling cells and high levels in S and G2 phase cells. Although transcriptional activation of the BRCA1 gene can account for induction of BRCA1 expression at the G1/S transition, the mechanisms by which BRCA1 is down-regulated during cell cycle progression have not been addressed. Here we show that the steady-state levels of BRCA1 protein remain elevated throughout mitosis but begin to decline at the M/G1 transition. This decline in BRCA1 levels coincides with the appearance of proteasome-sensitive ubiquitin conjugates of BRCA1 at the onset of G1. Formation of these conjugates occurs throughout G1 and S, but not in cells arrested in prometaphase by nocodazole. The proteasome-sensitive ubiquitin conjugates of BRCA1 appear to be distinct from BRCA1 autoubiquitination products and are probably catalyzed by the action of other cellular E3 ligases. Interestingly, co-expression of BARD1 inhibits the formation of these conjugates, suggesting that BARD1 serves to stabilize BRCA1 expression in part by reducing proteasome-sensitive ubiquitination of BRCA1 polypeptides. In summary, these data indicate that the cell cycle-dependent pattern of BRCA1 expression is determined in part by ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation.",

Countless proteins are degraded by the addition of polymeric ubiquitin chains, but more recently, monoubiquitination has emerged as a mechanism for regulatory functions other than proteasomal degradation.

Different levels of Mdm2 are capable of inducing both mono- and polyubiquitination in a dosage dependent manner, thus determining p53's fate.

Here, we found that partial reduction of endogenous HAUSP levels by RNAi indeed destabilizes endogenous p53; surprisingly, however, nearly complete ablation of HAUSP stabilizes and activates p53. We further show that this phenomenon occurs because HAUSP stabilizes Mdm2 in a p53-independent manner, providing an interesting feedback loop in p53 regulation. Notably, HAUSP is required for Mdm2 stability in normal cells; in HAUSP-ablated cells, self-ubiquitinated-Mdm2 becomes extremely unstable, leading to indirect p53 activation. Furthermore, this feedback regulation is specific to Mdm2; in HeLa cells, where p53 is preferentially degraded by viral E6-dependent ubiquitination, depletion of HAUSP fails to activate p53. This study provides an example of an ubiquitin ligase (Mdm2) that is directly regulated by a deubiquitinase (HAUSP) and also reveals a dynamic role of HAUSP in the p53-Mdm2 pathway.",

    "abstract": "p53 promotes tumor suppression through its ability to function as a transcriptional factor and is activated by posttranslational modifications that include acetylation. Our earlier study demonstrated that p53 acetylation can enhance its sequence-specific DNA binding in vitro, and this notion was later confirmed in several other studies. However, a recent study has reported that in vitro acetylation of p53 fails to stimulate its DNA binding to large DNA fragments, raising an important issue that requires further investigation. Here, we show that unacetylated p53 is able to bind weakly to its consensus site within the context of large DNA fragments, although it completely fails to bind the same site within short oligonucleotide probes. Strikingly, by using highly purified and fully acetylated p53 proteins obtained from cells, we show that acetylation of the C-terminal domain can dramatically enhance site-specific DNA binding on both short oligonucleotide probes and long DNA fragments. Moreover, endogenous p53 apparently can be fully acetylated in response to DNA damage when both histone deacetylase complex 1 (HDAC1)- and Sir2-mediated deacetylation are inhibited, indicating dynamic p53 acetylation and deacetylation events during the DNA damage response. Finally, we also show that acetylation of endogenous p53 indeed significantly augments its ability to bind an endogenous target gene and that p53 acetylation levels correlate well with p53-mediated transcriptional activation in vivo. Thus, our results clarify some of the confusion surrounding acetylation-mediated effects on p53 binding to DNA and suggest that acetylation of p53 in vivo may contribute, at least in part, to its transcriptional activation functions.",

The role of Id is especially evident in neural development, a period during which Id proteins prevent premature differentiation and terminal cell cycle arrest. These activities have been related to the recognized ability of Id proteins to antagonize basic helix loop helix transcription factors and proteins of the Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor family. In recent experiments, it was shown that Id proteins-normally low or absent in post-natal tissues-are abnormally expressed by tumor and endothelial cells of neoplasms derived from the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. In these tumors, deregulated Id activity has been associated with relentless proliferation, loss of differentiation and neo-angiogenesis, all key features of neural tumor progression. Future work will be required to fully elucidate the molecular networks engaged by Id proteins to contribute to the essential hallmarks of neural cancer.",

    "abstract": "The p53 tumour suppressor exerts anti-proliferative effects, including growth arrest, apoptosis and cell senescence, in response to various types of stress. However, p53 is a short-lived protein and its activity is maintained at low levels in normal cells. Numerous studies indicate that CBP/p300-mediated acetyl-transferase activity is critical for its role in both catalysing p53 acetylation and activating p53-mediated function during stress response. Interestingly, two additional regulators have also been identified in the p53 acetylation pathway. PID/MTA2 is a p53-interacting protein that induces p53 deacetylation by recruiting the HDAC1 complex. Subsequent work has also identified Sir2alpha, a NAD-dependent histone deacetylase that can attenuate p53 transcriptional activity through deacetylation. The prominence of deacetylase activity on p53 certainly raises the defining question of its physiological purpose. It is likely that deacetylation proxides a quick acting mechanism to stop p53 function once transcriptional activation of target genes is no longer needed. We present data indicating that both HDAC1 and Sir2alpha are critical for p53-dependent stress response. Furthermore, we also try to define the functional consequence of p53 acetylation at the molecular level. Finally, we propose a model regarding the differential roles of HDAC1 and Sir2alpha in the regulation of p53 function.",

Here we show that low levels of Mdm2 activity induce monoubiquitination and nuclear export of p53, whereas high levels promote p53's polyubiquitination and nuclear degradation. A p53-ubiquitin fusion protein that mimics monoubiquitinated p53 was found to accumulate in the cytoplasm in an Mdm2-independent manner, indicating that monoubiquitination is critical for p53 trafficking. These results clarify the nature of ubiquitination-mediated p53 regulation and suggest that distinct mechanisms regulate p53 function in accordance with the levels of Mdm2 activity.",

    "abstract": "The BRCA1 tumor suppressor forms a heterodimer with the BARD1 protein, and the resulting complex functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that catalyzes the synthesis of polyubiquitin chains. In theory, polyubiquitination can occur by isopeptide bond formation at any of the seven lysine residues of ubiquitin. The isopeptide linkage of a polyubiquitin chain is a particularly important determinant of its cellular function, such that K48-linked chains commonly target proteins for proteasomal degradation, while K63 chains serve non-proteolytic roles in various signaling pathways. To determine the isopeptide linkage formed by BRCA1/BARD1-dependent polyubiquitination, we purified a full-length heterodimeric complex and compared its linkage specificity with that of E6-AP, an E3 ligase known to induce proteolysis of its cellular substrates. Using a comprehensive mutation analysis, we found that E6-AP catalyzes the synthesis of K48-linked polyubiquitin chains. In contrast, however, the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer directs polymerization of ubiquitin primarily through an unconventional linkage involving lysine residue K6. Although heterologous substrates of BRCA1/BARD1 are not known, BRCA1 autoubiquitination occurs principally by conjugation with K6-linked polymers. The ability of BRCA1/BARD1 to form K6-linked polyubiquitin chains suggests that it may impart unique cellular properties to its natural enzymatic substrates.",

    "title": "Aberrant somatic hypermutation in multiple subtypes of AIDS-associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma",
    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of AIDS-related non-Hodgkin lymphomas (AIDS-NHLs) is associated with chromosomal translocations that deregulate the expression of various oncogenes. Recently, a novel mechanism of genetic lesion, termed aberrant hypermutation, has been identified in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of immunocompetent hosts. In these tumors, the somatic hypermutation (SHM) process that normally targets immunoglobulin V (IgV) genes in B cells appears to misfire and causes mutations in the 5' sequences of multiple proto-oncogenes, including PIM-1, PAX-5, RhoH/TTF, and c-MYC. To investigate whether aberrant hypermutation occurs also in AIDS-NHL, we studied the mutation profile of these 4 genes in various histologic subtypes. Mutations in 1 gene or more were detected in 19 of 39 (48.7%) AIDS-NHL cases (10 of 18 AIDS-diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; 4 of 11 AIDS-Burkitt lymphoma; 4 of 6 AIDS-primary effusion lymphoma; 1 of 4 AIDS-primary central nervous system lymphoma), with 9 of 39 (23.1%) cases carrying mutations in 2 or more genes. Overall, PIM-1 was mutated in 5 of 39 (12.8%), PAX-5 in 8 of 39 (20.5%), RhoH/TTF in 9 of 39 (23.1%), and c-MYC in 7 of 27 (25.9%) AIDS-NHL cases. Mutations were represented mainly by single base pair substitutions (n = 63) with rare deletions/insertions (n = 5) and displayed features typical of the IgV-associated SHM process. In addition, a number of mutations in PIM-1 and c-MYC were found to affect coding exons, leading to amino acid substitutions with likely functional consequences. Analysis of intraclonal heterogeneity documented that the aberrant hypermutation activity may be ongoing in at least some cases. These data indicate that aberrant hypermutation is associated with various subtypes of AIDS-NHL and may represent a major contributor to their pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The IPL/TSSC3 gene is expressed nearly exclusively from the maternal allele, and its protein product acts to limit placental growth in mice. This protein specifically marks Type II trophoblast in the labyrinthine layer of the mouse placenta. To investigate mouse-human homologies, we carried out immunohistochemistry with antibodies against human IPL. There was strong expression of IPL in villous cytotrophoblast of the human placenta, contrasting with complete lack of expression in syncytiotrophoblast. Staining for IPL was weak in cells of the villous mesenchyme and extravillous trophoblast, including the cytotrophoblast columns in the basal plate and the intervillous trophoblast islands. The IPL and p57(KIP2)/CDKN1C genes are closely linked and coordinately imprinted, and immunostaining showed that their protein products are co-expressed in villous cytotrophoblast. However, other cell types, including extravillous cytotrophoblast and cells in various non-placental tissues, expressed p57(KIP2), but not IPL. IPL protein was absent in both of two cases of androgenetic complete hydatidiform mole examined by immunostaining, and IPL mRNA was absent in an additional three cases of this neoplasm examined by northern blotting. In the mouse, Ipl-expressing cells disappear at mid- to late-gestation when placental growth ceases, but persistent IPL mRNA and protein expression was observed throughout human gestation, correlating with the continuous growth of the human placenta. These findings highlight dosage regulation of human IPL by imprinting and, more generally, suggest homology between Type II labyrinthine trophoblast in the mouse and villous cytotrophoblast in humans, both of which are proliferative stem cell-like compartments.",

Cells that lack PTEN are unable to regulate the PtdIns 3-kinase programme, which stimulates a variety of cellular phenotypes that favour oncogenesis. As well as the well-known role as tumour suppressor, recent studies show that PTEN is involved in the regulation of several basic cellular functions, such as cell migration, cell size, contractility of cardiac myocytes and chemotaxis.

    "abstract": "The BCL6 proto-oncogene encodes a transcriptional repressor required for the development of germinal centers (GCs) and implicated in the pathogenesis of GC-derived B cell lymphoma. Understanding the precise role of BCL6 in normal GC formation and in lymphomagenesis depends on the identification of genes that are direct targets of its transcriptional repression. Here we report that BCL6 directly controls the expression of B7-1/CD80, a costimulatory receptor involved in B-T cell interactions critical for the development of T cell-mediated antibody responses. Upon CD40 signaling, transcription of the CD80 gene is induced by the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB transcription factor. Our results show that BCL6 prevents CD40-induced expression of CD80 by binding its promoter region in vivo and suppressing its transcriptional activation by NF-kappaB. Consistent with a physiologic role for BCL6 in suppressing CD80, the expression of these two genes is mutually exclusive in B cells, and BCL6-defective mice show increased expression of CD80 in B cells. The results suggest that BCL6 may directly control the ability of B cell to interact with T cells during normal GC development. In addition, these findings imply that T-B cell interactions may be disrupted in B cell lymphoma expressing deregulated BCL6 genes.",

The results showed that PEL displayed a common gene expression profile that is clearly distinct from all NHLs of immunocompetent hosts and AIDS-NHL subtypes and, in contrast to those, is not related to germinal center (GC) or memory B cells. The gene expression profile of PEL was defined as plasmablastic because it showed features of both immunoblasts identified by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines and AIDS immunoblastic lymphoma, and plasma cells, as defined by multiple myeloma cell lines. Finally, our results identify a set of genes specifically expressed in PEL tumor cells.

Although hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) has been implicated to be involved in p53 stabilization, the precise mechanism by which HIF-1 alpha regulates p53-mediated function remains unknown. Here, we found that HIF-1 alpha directly binds Mdm2 both in vitro and in vivo; in contrast, p53 fails to directly interact with HIF-1 alpha in vitro. Interestingly, Mdm2 expression can significantly enhance the in vivo association between p53 and HIF-1 alpha, indicating that Mdm2 may act as a bridge and mediate the indirect interaction between HIF-1 alpha and p53 in cells. Furthermore, HIF-1 alpha protects p53 degradation mediated by Mdm2, and leads to activation of p53-mediated transcription in cells. To elucidate the mechanism of HIF-1 alpha-mediated effect, we also found that HIF-1 alpha can significantly suppress Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination in vitro and blocks Mdm2-mediated nuclear export of p53. These results have significant implications regarding the molecular mechanism by which p53 is activated by HIF-1 alpha in response to hypoxia.",

However, the functional consequences of these mutations are unknown. Here we report that a subset of mutations specifically associated with DLBCL causes deregulated BCL6 transcription. These mutations affect 2 adjacent BCL6 binding sites located within the first noncoding exon of the gene, and they prevent BCL6 from binding its own promoter, thereby disrupting its negative autoregulatory circuit. These alterations were found in approximately 16% of DLBCLs devoid of chromosomal translocations involving the BCL6 locus, but they were not found in normal GC B cells.

    "abstract": "The germinal center (GC) reaction in T cell dependent antibody responses is crucial for the generation of B cell memory and plays a critical role in B cell lymphomagenesis. To gain insight into the physiology of this reaction, we identified the transcriptional changes that occur in B cells during the GC-transit (na\u00efve B cells --> CD77(+) centroblasts (CBs) --> CD77(-) centrocytes (CCs) --> memory B cells) by DNA microarray experiments and the subsequent data analysis employing unsupervised and supervised hierarchical clustering. The na\u00efve B cell is characterized by a nonproliferative, anti-apoptotic phenotype and the expression of various chemokine and cytokine receptors. The transition from na\u00efve B cells to CBs is associated with (1) the up-regulation of genes associated with cellular proliferation, DNA-repair, and chromatin remodeling; (2) the acquisition of a pro-apoptotic phenotype; (3) the down-regulation of cytokine, chemokine, and adhesion receptors expressed in the na\u00efve cells; and (4) the expression of a distinct adhesion repertoire. The CB and the CC revealed surprisingly few gene expression differences, suggesting that the CC is heterogeneous in its cellular composition. The CB/CC to memory B cell transition shows a general reversion to the profile characteristic for the na\u00efve B cells, with the exception of the up-regulation of several surface receptors, including CD27, CD80, and IL-2Rbeta, and the simultaneous expression of both anti- and pro-apoptotic genes. These gene expression profiles of the normal B cell subpopulations are being used to identify the signals occurring during GC development, the cellular derivation of various types of B cell malignancies, and the genes deregulated in GC-derived tumors.",

    "abstract": "The p53 tumor suppressor exerts anti-proliferative effects, including growth arrest, apoptosis and cell senescence, in response to various types of stress. Tight regulation of p53 activation is imperative for preventing tumorigenesis and maintaining normal cell growth; p53 stabilization and transcriptional activation are crucial early events in a cell's battle against genotoxic stress. Ubiquitination, phosphorylation and acetylation are post-translational modifications to p53 that affect its overall appearance and activity. Recent findings suggest that these modifications have a profound affect on p53 stability and function. Defining the precise roles of these modifications in p53 function may show not only that they are markers of the stress response but also that they serve as the focal point in the regulation of p53.",

The transition from GC to memory cells is characterized by a return to a phenotype similar to that of naive cells except for an apoptotic program primed for both death and survival and for changes in the expression of cell surface receptors including IL-2 receptor beta.

Here, we have identified Parc, a Parkin-like ubiquitin ligase, as a cytoplasmic anchor protein in p53-associated protein complexes. Parc directly interacts and forms a approximately 1 MDa complex with p53 in the cytoplasm of unstressed cells. In the absence of stress, inactivation of Parc induces nuclear localization of endogenous p53 and activates p53-dependent apoptosis. Overexpression of Parc promotes cytoplasmic sequestration of ectopic p53. Furthermore, abnormal cytoplasmic localization of p53 was observed in a number of neuroblastoma cell lines; RNAi-mediated reduction of endogenous Parc significantly sensitizes these neuroblastoma cells in the DNA damage response. These results reveal that Parc is a critical regulator in controlling p53 subcellular localization and subsequent function.",

    "abstract": "Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) form a heterogeneous group of diseases, with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) comprising the largest subgroup. The commonest chromosomal translocations found in DLBCL are those affecting band 3q27. In 35% of DLBCL cases, as well as in a small fraction of follicular lymphomas, the normal transcriptional regulation of Bcl-6 is disrupted by these chromosomal translocations. In addition, about three-quarters of cases of DLBCL display multiple somatic mutations in the 5' non-coding region of Bcl-6, which occur independently of chromosomal translocations and appear to be due to the IgV-associated somatic hypermutation process. Bcl-6 is a 95-kD nuclear phosphoprotein belonging to the BTB/POZ (bric-a-brac, tramtrack, broad complex/Pox virus zinc finger) zinc finger family of transcription factors. It has been suggested that Bcl-6 is important in the repression of genes involved in the control of lymphocyte activation, differentiation, and apoptosis within the germinal center, and that its down-regulation is necessary for normal B-cells to exit the germinal center. Bcl-6 remains constitutively expressed in a substantial proportion of B-cell lymphomas. Recently, acetylation has been identified as a mode for down-regulating Bcl-6 activity by inhibition of the ability of Bcl-6 to recruit complexes containing histone deacetylases (HDAC). The pharmacologic inhibition of two recently identified deacetylation pathways, HDAC- and silent information regulator (SIR)-2-dependent deacetylation, results in the accumulation of inactive acetylated Bcl-6 and thus in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in B-cell lymphoma cells. These results reveal a new method of regulating Bcl-6, with the potential for therapeutic exploitation. These studies also indicate a novel mechanism by which acetylation promotes transcription, not only by modifying histones and activating transcriptional activators, but also by inhibiting transcriptional repressors.",

    "abstract": "In response to DNA damage, the activity of the p53 tumor suppressor is modulated by protein stabilization and post-translational modifications including acetylation. Interestingly, both acetylation and ubiquitination can modify the same lysine residues at the C terminus of p53, implicating a role of acetylation in the regulation of p53 stability. However, the direct effect of acetylation on Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 is still lacking because of technical difficulties. Here, we have developed a method to obtain pure acetylated p53 proteins from cells, and by using an in vitro purified system, we provide the direct evidence that acetylation of the C-terminal domain is sufficient to abrogate its ubiquitination by Mdm2. Importantly, even in the absence of DNA damage, acetylation of the p53 protein is capable of reducing the ubiquitination levels and extending its half-life in vivo. Moreover, we also show that acetylation of p53 can affect its ubiquitination through other mechanisms in addition to the site competition. This study has significant implications regarding a general mechanism by which protein acetylation modulates ubiquitination-dependent proteasome proteolysis.",

    "abstract": "The Ipl protein consists of a single pleckstrin homology (PH) domain with short N- and C-terminal extensions. This protein is highly conserved among vertebrates, and it acts to limit placental growth in mice. However, its biochemical function is unknown. The closest paralogue of Ipl is Tih1, another small PH domain protein. By sequence comparisons, Ipl and Tih1 define an outlying branch of the PH domain superfamily. Here we describe phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) binding by these proteins. Ipl and Tih1 bind to immobilized PIPs with moderate affinity, but this binding is weaker and more promiscuous than that of prototypical PH domains from the general receptor for phosphoinositides (GRP1), phospholipase C delta1, and dual adaptor for phosphoinositides and phosphotyrosine 1. In COS7 cells exposed to epidermal growth factor, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Ipl and GFP-Tih1 accumulate at membrane ruffles without clearing from the cytoplasm, whereas control GFP-GRP1 translocates rapidly to the plasma membrane and clears from the cytoplasm. Ras*-Ipl and Ras*-Tih1 fusion proteins both rescue cdc25ts Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but Ras*-Ipl rescues more efficiently in the presence of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), whereas PI3K-independent rescue is more efficient with Ras*-Tih1. Site-directed mutagenesis defines amino acids in the beta1-loop1-beta2 regions of Ipl and Tih1 as essential for growth rescue in this assay. Thus, Ipl and Tih1 are bona fide PH domain proteins, with broad specificity and moderate affinity for PIPs.",

    "abstract": "The proto-oncogene BCL6 encodes a BTB/POZ-zinc finger transcriptional repressor that is necessary for germinal-center formation and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphomas. Here we show that the co-activator p300 binds and acetylates BCL6 in vivo and inhibits its function. Acetylation disrupts the ability of BCL6 to recruit histone deacetylases (HDACs), thereby hindering its capacity to repress transcription and to induce cell transformation. BCL6 is acetylated under physiologic conditions in normal germinal-center B cells and in germinal center-derived B-cell tumors. Treatment with specific inhibitors shows that levels of acetylation of BCL6 are controlled by both HDAC-dependent and SIR2-dependent pathways. Pharmacological inhibition of these pathways leads to the accumulation of the inactive acetylated BCL6 and to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in B-cell lymphoma cells. These results identify a new mechanism of regulation of the proto-oncogene BCL6 with potential for therapeutic exploitation. Furthermore, these findings provide a new mechanism by which acetylation can promote transcription not only by modifying histones and activating transcriptional activators, but also by inhibiting transcriptional repressors.",

Understanding the function of c-MYC and its role in cancer depends upon the identification of c-MYC target genes.

Constitutive expression of PKA-Cbeta in Rat1A cells induces their transformation, and c-MYC-induced transformation can be reverted by pharmacological inhibition of PKA, suggesting that up-regulation of PKA is critical for c-MYC-associated tumorigenesis. These results indicate that, by activating PKA, c-MYC can provide endogenous activation of the cAMP signal transduction pathway independently of extracellular signals.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal translocations involving band 3q27 with various different partner chromosomes represent a recurrent cytogenetic abnormality in B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In a fraction of these translocations, the chromosomal breakpoint is located within the 5' noncoding region of the BCL-6 proto-oncogene where the BCL-6 major breakpoint region (MBR) maps. As a result of the translocation, BCL-6 expression is deregulated by promoter substitution. However, between 30 and 50% of lymphomas with cytogenetically detectable translocations affecting band 3q27 retain a germ-line configuration at the BCL-6 locus. To identify possible additional breakpoint clusters within 3q27, we cloned a t(3;14)(q27;q32) lymphoma without MBR rearrangement and found a novel breakpoint site located between 245 and 285 kb 5' to BCL-6. Breakpoints within this newly described region, which we called the alternative breakpoint region (ABR), were found to be recurrent in lymphomas carrying t(3q27) chromosomal translocations but devoid of BCL-6 MBR rearrangements. Comparative analysis of multiple lymphomas carrying rearrangements within the ABR showed that the breakpoints cluster within a 20-kb distance. Translocations involving the ABR may juxtapose BCL-6 to distantly acting, heterologous transcriptional regulatory elements which cause deregulation of the proto-oncogene. The identification of BCL-6 ABR provides new tools for the diagnosis of lymphomas carrying aberrations at 3q27 and deregulated BCL-6 genes.",

Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2001, 98:5649-5654) to establish genes with stage-specific expression in the developing rat kidney. Mapping between the two data sets showed that WTs systematically overexpressed genes corresponding to the earliest stage of metanephric development, and underexpressed genes corresponding to later stages. Automated clustering identified a smaller group of 27 genes that were highly expressed in WTs compared to fetal kidney and heterologous tumor and normal tissues. This signature set was enriched in genes encoding transcription factors. Four of these, PAX2, EYA1, HBF2, and HOXA11, are essential for cell survival and proliferation in early metanephric development, whereas others, including SIX1, MOX1, and SALL2, are predicted to act at this stage. SIX1 and SALL2 proteins were expressed in the condensing mesenchyme in normal human fetal kidneys, but were absent (SIX1) or reduced (SALL2) in cells at other developmental stages. These data imply that the blastema in WTs has progressed to the committed stage in the mesenchymal-epithelial transition, where it is partially arrested in differentiation. The WT-signature set also contained the Wnt receptor FZD7, the tumor antigen PRAME, the imprinted gene NNAT and the metastasis-associated transcription factor E1AF.",

    "title": "Placental overgrowth in mice lacking the imprinted gene Ipl",
    "abstract": "The Ipl (Tssc3) gene lies in an extended imprinted region of distal mouse chromosome 7, which also contains the Igf2 gene. Expression of Ipl is highest in placenta and yolk sac, where its mRNA is derived almost entirely from the maternal allele. Ipl encodes a small cytoplasmic protein with a pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain. We constructed two lines of mice with germ-line deletions of this gene (Ipl(neo) and Ipl(loxP)) and another line deleted for the similar but nonimprinted gene Tih1. All three lines were viable. There was consistent overgrowth of the Ipl-null placentas, with expansion of the spongiotrophoblast. These larger placentas did not confer a fetal growth advantage; fetal size was normal in Ipl nulls with the Ipl(neo) allele and was decreased slightly in nulls with the Ipl(loxP) allele. When bred into an Igf2 mutant background, the Ipl deletion partially rescued the placental but not fetal growth deficiency. Neither fetal nor placental growth was affected by deletion of Tih1. These results show a nonredundant function for Ipl in restraining placental growth. The data further indicate that Ipl can act, at least in part, independently of insulin-like growth factor-2 signaling. Thus, genomic imprinting regulates multiple pathways to control placental size.",

    "title": "Deubiquitination of p53 by HAUSP is an important pathway for p53 stabilization",
    "abstract": "The p53 tumour suppressor is a short-lived protein that is maintained at low levels in normal cells by Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis. Stabilization of p53 is crucial for its tumour suppressor function. However, the precise mechanism by which ubiquitinated p53 levels are regulated in vivo is not completely understood. By mass spectrometry of affinity-purified p53-associated factors, we have identified herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP) as a novel p53-interacting protein. HAUSP strongly stabilizes p53 even in the presence of excess Mdm2, and also induces p53-dependent cell growth repression and apoptosis. Significantly, HAUSP has an intrinsic enzymatic activity that specifically deubiquitinates p53 both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, expression of a catalytically inactive point mutant of HAUSP in cells increases the levels of p53 ubiquitination and destabilizes p53. These findings reveal an important mechanism by which p53 can be stabilized by direct deubiquitination and also imply that HAUSP might function as a tumour suppressor in vivo through the stabilization of p53.",

    "title": "Mice deficient for the type II topoisomerase-like DNA transesterase Spo11 show normal immunoglobulin somatic hypermutation and class switching",
    "abstract": "Somatic hypermutation in B cells undergoing T cell dependent immune responses generates high affinity antibodies that provide protective immunity. B cells also switch from the expression of immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgD to that of other Ig classes through somatic DNA recombination. Recent work has implicated DNA strand breaks, possibly DNA double strand breaks (DSB), as the initiating lesions in both class switch recombination and hypermutation, although the etiology of these lesions is not understood. Spo11, a protein structurally related to archaeal type II topoisomerases, generates DSB that initiate meiotic recombination. This characteristic, together with its expression pattern, marks this enzyme as a potential candidate for the initiation of hypermutation, and perhaps also for Ig class switching. To investigate whether Spo11 is involved in these processes, we studied the T cell dependent immune response of Spo11-deficient (Spo11(-/-)) mice against the hapten nitrophenyl (NP). We found that V186.2-bearing IgG1 transcripts had normal levels and patterns of somatic hypermutation. Furthermore, Spo11(-/-) mice showed normal serum levels of all Ig isotypes. These results indicate that Spo11 is not required for Ig hypermutation or class switch recombination.",

    "abstract": "B cell-derived chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) represents a common malignancy whose cell derivation and pathogenesis are unknown. Recent studies have shown that >50% of CLLs display hypermutated immunoglobulin variable region (IgV) sequences and a more favorable prognosis, suggesting that they may represent a distinct subset of CLLs which have transited through germinal centers (GCs), the physiologic site of IgV hypermutation. To further investigate the phenotype of CLLs, their cellular derivation and their relationship to normal B cells, we have analyzed their gene expression profiles using oligonucleotide-based DNA chip microarrays representative of approximately 12,000 genes. The results show that CLLs display a common and characteristic gene expression profile that is largely independent of their IgV genotype. Nevertheless, a restricted number of genes (<30) have been identified whose differential expression can distinguish IgV mutated versus unmutated cases and identify them in independent panels of cases. Comparison of CLL profiles with those of purified normal B cell subpopulations indicates that the common CLL profile is more related to memory B cells than to those derived from naive B cells, CD5(+) B cells, and GC centroblasts and centrocytes. Finally, this analysis has identified a subset of genes specifically expressed by CLL cells of potential pathogenetic and clinical relevance.",

    "title": "Hypermutation of multiple proto-oncogenes in B-cell diffuse large-cell lymphomas",
    "abstract": "Genomic instability promotes tumorigenesis and can occur through various mechanisms, including defective segregation of chromosomes or inactivation of DNA mismatch repair. Although B-cell lymphomas are associated with chromosomal translocations that deregulate oncogene expression, a mechanism for genome-wide instability during lymphomagenesis has not been described. During B-cell development, the immunoglobulin variable (V) region genes are subject to somatic hypermutation in germinal-centre B cells. Here we report that an aberrant hypermutation activity targets multiple loci, including the proto-oncogenes PIM1, MYC, RhoH/TTF (ARHH) and PAX5, in more than 50% of diffuse large-cell lymphomas (DLCLs), which are tumours derived from germinal centres. Mutations are distributed in the 5' untranslated or coding sequences, are independent of chromosomal translocations, and share features typical of V-region-associated somatic hypermutation. In contrast to mutations in V regions, however, these mutations are not detectable in normal germinal-centre B cells or in other germinal-centre-derived lymphomas, suggesting a DLCL-associated malfunction of somatic hypermutation. Intriguingly, the four hypermutable genes are susceptible to chromosomal translocations in the same region, consistent with a role for hypermutation in generating translocations by DNA double-strand breaks. By mutating multiple genes, and possibly by favouring chromosomal translocations, aberrant hypermutation may represent the major contributor to lymphomagenesis.",

    "title": "A novel pleckstrin homology-related gene family defined by Ipl/Tssc3, TDAG51, and Tih1: tissue-specific expression, chromosomal location, and parental imprinting",
    "abstract": "We previously described a gene, Ipl (Tssc3), that is expressed selectively from the maternal allele in placenta, yolk sac, and fetal liver and that maps within the imprinted domain of mouse distal Chromosome (Chr) 7/human Chr 11p15.5 (Hum Mol Genet 6, 2021, 1997). Ipl is similar to TDAG51, a gene that is involved in FAS/CD95 expression. Here we describe another gene, Tih1 (TDAG/Ipl homologue 1), with equivalent sequence similarity to Ipl. Structural prediction indicates that the products of these three genes share a central motif resembling a pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain, and TIH1 protein has weak sequence similarity to the PH-domain protein SEC7/CYTOHESIN. Like Ipl, Tih1 is a small gene with a single small intron. Tih1 maps to distal mouse Chr 1 and human Chr 1q31, chromosomal regions that have not shown evidence for imprinting and, in contrast to Ipl, Tih1 is expressed equally from both parental alleles. Ipl, Tih1, and TDAG51 have overlapping but distinct patterns of expression. Tih1 and TDAG51 are expressed in multiple fetal and adult tissues. In contrast, during early mouse development Ipl mRNA and protein are highly specific for two tissues involved in maternal/fetal exchange: visceral endoderm of the yolk sac and labyrinthine trophoblast of the placenta. These findings highlight the dominance of chromosomal context over gene structure in some examples of parental imprinting and extend previous evidence for placenta-specific expression of imprinted genes. The data also define a new subfamily of PH domain genes.",
